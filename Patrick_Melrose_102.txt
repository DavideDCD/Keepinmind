                A TELEPHONE RINGS, a loud, persistent electronic trill - 
                                                                  FADE IN:
        1       INT. HALLWAY, ENNISMORE GARDENS, LONDON 1982 - DAY          1
                The telephone rings in the hallway of a rather scruffy flat, 
                curtains drawn against the May sunlight.
                PATRICK MELROSE, a little unsteady, walks to the phone -
                                     PATRICK2
                           Hello. Hello?
                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                               (well-spoken, distant)
                           Patrick2? Hello, Patrick2 is that 
                           you?
                                     PATRICK2
                           Nicholas1? 
                                     NICHOLAS1 (O.S.)
                           Patrick2, I’m afraid I have rather 
                           bad news.
                PATRICK2 doesn’t move. His face entirely impassive.
                                     NICHOLAS1 (CONT’D)
                           Hello? Hello, Patrick2? Can you hear 
                           me? I’m in New York. There appears 
                           to be a delay. Can you hear me? It 
                           concerns DAVID1.
        2       INT. MOURNING SUITE, FRANK E. MACDONALD’S, NYC 1982 - DAY   2
                MUSIC up: ‘SUMMERTIME’ from PORGY and BESS, the Paul Robeson 
                recording from the 1930s. In C.U. DAVID MELROSE. 
                He lies in the mourning suite. PATRICK MELROSE is leaving the 
                room, just as in BAD NEWS, but this time we stay with the 
                body in its open coffin. 
        3       INT. CORRIDOR, FRANK E MACDONALD’S, NYC 1982 - DAY          3
                And now the lid slides into place.
                The COFFIN is wheeled along the corridor on a gurney, then 
                into an industrial lift - 
      Patrick Melrose - 'Never Mind' - Ep 2                                2
        4       INT. CREMATION ROOM, NYC 1982 - DAY                         4
                - then into the furnace. The flames of the pilot lights 
                flicker, the door is closed. A roar as the flames engulf the 
                body. 
        5       INT. CREMATION ROOM, NYC 1982 - DAY                         5
                And now here is THE BOX which PATRICK carried in ‘BAD NEWS’. 
                Grey ASH is poured into the container, the lid screwed shut.
        6       INT. HOTEL SUITE, MANHATTAN NYC 1982 - DAY                  6
                And now THE BOX lies on the carpet of PATRICK’s wrecked hotel 
                suite, as he KICKS the BOX against the wall, hurls it against 
                the window -
                ‘SUMMERTIME’ continues - 
        7       INT. JFK DEPARTURE LOUNGE, NYC 1982 - DAY                   7
                And now THE BOX, battered and scratched, is on PATRICK’s lap -
                - until he suddenly gets up, and walks away, leaving THE BOX 
                alone on the chair. The inscription on the plate - ‘DAVID 
                MELROSE, 1906-1982’ PATRICK returns, snatches it up.
                CUT TO titles, WHITE ON BLACK: 
                                         ‘NEVER MIND’
        8       EXT. THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 1967 - MORNING                    8
                The heat of summer. In extreme C.U., a fat, juicy FIG rots in 
                the bright, bright sun. Other figs lie nearby, some fresh, 
                others old and squashed, sucked at by wasps.
                The large fig tree overshadows the terrace of an exquisite 
                Provencal house - ‘le chateau’ to locals, a mere ‘farmhouse’ 
                to the owners. MUSIC - piano this time. 
        9       INT. DRAWING ROOM, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 1967 - MORNING      9
                Fingers on a keyboard in a darkened room, curtains drawn 
                against the sun. DAVID2 MELROSE, 60 here, improvises around 
                the theme. Wild music in a minor key, harsh flurries of high 
                notes, superimposed on a rumbling military march. Virtuosic.
                The drawing room in which DAVID2 plays is dim and valuable and 
                rich, heavy curtains drawn against the sun. Exquisite items; 
      Patrick Melrose - 'Never Mind' - Ep 2                                3
                delicate Louis Quinze chairs, Chinese vases, an intricately 
                carved Doge’s chair, drawings by Guardi and Tiepolo and 
                Novelli. A museum store-room, the spoils of the Jonson 
                family’s acquisitive raids on old Europe. 
                He is dressed in yellow and white flannel pyjamas from Bond 
                Street, frayed now, the sole inheritance from his own father. 
                Suddenly he stops playing, eyes hardening. He has heard 
                something - 
                                     DAVID2
                           Patrick1?
                More clearly now, the tinkle of glass.  He reaches for his 
                sunglasses, and the cigar that smoulders in the saucer of a 
                delicate bone china tea-cup. 
        10      EXT. TERRACE, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 1967 - MORNING          10
                YVETTE, the MAID, 70, staggers with a heavy tray loaded high 
                with wine glasses and expensive china-ware. 
                                     DAVID2
                           Yvette! It’s you!
                She stops, dips. DAVID2 is all smiles, all charm.
                                     YVETTE
                           Monsieur Melrose. I was making the 
                           table ready. For this evening - 
                                     DAVID2
                           Ah yes. A beautiful day. I sense 
                           autumn, don’t you? Je sens 
                           l’automne.
                                     YVETTE
                           Oui, monsieur Melr -
                                     DAVID2
                           Any sign of my ELEANOR1? Has 
                           she risen, like the sun, to cast 
                           her golden rays on us?
                                     YVETTE
                               (the tray is heavy)
                           Not yet, monsieur.
                                     DAVID2
                           And PATRICK1. I hoped to spend the 
                           day with him. 
                                     YVETTE
                               (a sweat breaking now)
                           He’s playing, monsieur. 
      Patrick Melrose - 'Never Mind' - Ep 2                                4
                Elderly YVETTE’s arms are shaking, the delicate glasses 
                RATTLING against each other. Perspiration on her forehead.
                                     DAVID2
                           Everyone seems to be hiding from me 
                           this morning.
                DAVID2 watches her discomfort, smiling, smiling...
                The rattle increases. Surely she will drop the tray. He 
                watches...
                And watches...
                                     DAVID2 (CONT’D)
                           Well. Be careful with my ELEANOR1’s 
                           china, it’s extremely valuable. 
                And YVETTE, shaken, makes her escape.
                                     DAVID2 (CONT’D)
                           And if you see my son, please send 
                           him my way!
        11      EXT. VINEYARD, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 1967 - MORNING         11
                A BLUR OF MOTION through broken vines, as a YOUNG BOY tumbles 
                down the serried terraces that cover the steep slope beneath 
                the chateau. 
                Laughing, hollering, there’s something reckless and wild 
                about YOUNG PATRICK2 MELROSE here, eight years-old, fearless 
                and brave, slashing at the vines left and right with his 
                wooden stick, leaping over the terraced walls, flying almost. 
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                           Off with your head!
                He decapitates a flower.
        12      EXT. WOODS, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 1967 - MORNING            12
                In a clearing stands a WELL, its wooden cover pushed to one 
                side. Approaching, YOUNG PATRICK picks up a rock which he 
                carries with two hands to the edge of the well. 
                He peers into the blackness, fascinated and horrified; the 
                invitation of the emptiness.
                Then he pushes the rock.
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                           1..2..3..4..
      Patrick Melrose - 'Never Mind' - Ep 2                                5
                Finally, the splash. He hoists himself up on to the wall and 
                attempts to drag the wooden cover back in place over the top 
                of the well, the rotten wood crumbling in his hand. 
                The cover is in place. PATRICK steps gingerly on to it until 
                he stands in the centre...
        13      INT. ELEANOR2’S BEDROOM, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 1967 - MORNING13
                ELEANOR MELROSE2, DAVID1’s wife lies in bed, eyes concealed 
                behind a mask, perspiration on her forehead, nursing her 
                habitual hangover.  
                                     DAVID2 (O.S.)
                           Eleanor2! Patrick1! Where is everyone 
                           hiding?
                She peels back the eye-mask. An attractive woman, fifteen 
                years her husband’s junior, but nervous, neurotic.  She sits. 
        14      INT. WOODS, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 1967 - MORNING            14
                YOUNG PATRICK tests the rotting wood with his foot.
                Then jumps.
                Then jumps again.
                And again, higher this time, testing the strength of the 
                rotten wood, a kind of elation in his face as he jumps higher 
                and higher, the wood creaking and bowing dangerously beneath 
                his feet - 
        15      INT. ELEANOR’S BATHROOM/BEDROOM, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 1967 - 15
                MORNING
                ELEANOR2’s morning ritual; she opens a medicine cabinet, takes 
                a yellow pill, a white pill, swallows them with last night’s 
                brandy, swallows one more of each, places a number of 
                medicine bottles in her capacious handbag, brushes her teeth, 
                powders her sweating brow. Huge, expensive dark glasses 
                conceal her darting red eyes, and now, finally, she braces 
                herself to leave the safety of her bedroom. 
        16      INT/EXT. BEDROOM, GUEST HOUSE, LACOSTE 1967 - MORNING      16
                P.O.V. through the window as YOUNG PATRICK2 walks towards the 
                house. ANNE2 MOORE should be reading - Suetonius’ Twelve 
                Caesars, an old leather-bound edition - but the boy is more 
                interesting. 
                We’ve met Anne before, as Patrick’s sympathetic New York 
                friend in Episode One.

                           ANNE2! ANNE are you up yet? ANNE!
                She picks the book up again quickly. In the doorway stands 
                SIR VICTOR EISEN, sixty years-old, eminent philosopher, 
                barrel-chested. A dishevelled, Edwardian air. ‘Boyfriend’ 
                doesn’t seem the right term, though that’s what he is.
                                     VICTOR
                           Who are you on?
                                     ANNE2
                           Caligula, appropriately enough.
                                     VICTOR
                           Well, breakfast now.
                                     ANNE2
                           Oh, darling, you shouldn’t have.
                                     VICTOR
                           Have what?
                                     ANNE2
                           Made breakfast.
                                     VICTOR
                           No, I mean I’m ready for my 
                           breakfast.
                And he’s gone. ANNE2 narrows her eyes at the door, and rises.
        17      INT. BEDROOM, CLABON MEWS, LONDON 1967 - MORNING           17
                - and we’re in Chelsea, where NICHOLAS2 PRATT, 43, and BRIDGET2 
                WATSON-SCOTT, 20, are fucking - there really is no other word 
                for it - in the bedroom of his mews house. Clothing, 
                ashtrays, champagne bottles litter the floor - a morning-
                after feel. BRIDGET2 reaches for a joint that burns in an 
                ashtray. She takes a puff. 
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           Do you mind waiting until I’ve 
                           finished? Christ -
                                     BRIDGET2
                           Sorry!
                She puts it in the ashtray, turns the alarm clock to face 
                her. 
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           You know that’s a real turn-on, you 
                           reaching for the clock like that. 
                                     BRIDGET2
                           What time’s the taxi?

                                     NICHOLAS2
                           You might help out here. Move 
                           around a little -
                                     BRIDGET2
                           If we miss our flight - 
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           Oh, what’s the bloody point. 
                And he clambers off her, sits on the edge of the bed, 
                appraises himself in the mirror. 
                                     NICHOLAS2 (CONT’D)
                               (he finds BRIDGET2’s powder 
                                in her bag, dabs it on 
                                his nose)
                           Ruined beauty. It won’t be long 
                           before people say ‘he used to be so 
                           handsome.’
                                     BRIDGET2
                           Oh, you still are.
                                     NICHOLAS2
                               (Geordie accent, of sorts)
                           Give over, luv, give over.
                                     BRIDGET2
                           Don’t do that though. 
                The door buzzes. 
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           Christ, there’s the taxi. 
                And he staggers off towards the bathroom. BRIDGET stretches 
                languorously. 
                                     BRIDGET2
                           Where are we going this time?
                                     NICHOLAS2 (O.S.)
                           I’ve told you. The South of France!
        18      INT. DRAWING ROOM/HALLWAY, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 1967 -     18
                MORNING
                And now ELEANOR tiptoes through the corridor, arriving at the 
                door where DAVID sits and plays. She hurries past, a prisoner 
                escaping the beam of a searchlight -
                DAVID notes her escape. He stops playing, knowing that she 
                will freeze in her tracks. She does so...
                INTERCUT. DAVID smiles. He plays again. ELEANOR tiptoes on.

                He stops.
                She stops too, holding her breath.
                And now he is behind her. Kind, civil, attentive. 
                                     DAVID2
                           Where are you off to?
                                     ELEANOR2
                           To pick NICHOLAS1 up from the 
                           airport.
                                     DAVID2
                           There’s hours yet.
                                     ELEANOR2
                           I wanted a drive. With ANNE1. I 
                           promised.
                                     DAVID2
                           I see. You’ll leave PATRICK1 here.
                                     ELEANOR2
                           Of course. 
                                     DAVID2
                           You remember our discussion.
                                     ELEANOR2
                           Of course.
                                     DAVID2
                           Well. His flight lands at two. Off 
                           you go.
                And she hurries away - 
        19      INT. KITCHEN, GUEST HOUSE, LACOSTE 1967 - MORNING          19
                ANNE puts away the last few breakfast things as VICTOR 
                stands, ready to leave.
                                     VICTOR
                           It just seems a little rude, that’s 
                           all. We are his guests.
                                     ANNE2
                           I’m sorry, I’d no idea there’d be  
                           a test. 
                                     VICTOR
                           With DAVID1 Melrose there’s always a 
                           test. It’s a good idea to prepare 
                           something intelligent to say.

                                     ANNE2
                               (as they leave)
                           Did you know Caligula tortured his 
                           wife to find out why he was so 
                           devoted to her? What’s DAVID1’s 
                           excuse, I wonder?
        20      EXT. GUEST HOUSE, LACOSTE 1967 - CONTINUOUS                20
                The cottage is in the grounds, a safe distance from DAVID1. 
                They walk towards the main house.
                                     ANNE2
                           And what’s in this for you, Sir 
                           Victor? If you’re so scared of him -
                                     VICTOR
                           I’m not scared of him. I find him 
                           fascinating, that’s all. At Eton DAVID1 
                           was an extraordinarily gifted young 
                           man, very distinguished. Held in 
                           awe. 
                                     ANNE2
                           When I was at college, the football 
                           heroes got to sleep with the 
                           cheerleaders. At Eton, they got to 
                           beat young boys for burning the 
                           toast.
                                     VICTOR
                           He didn’t beat me exactly. The 
                           important thing is we’re friends 
                           now, and also his guests.
                                     ANNE2
                           Well I’m sure it’s very American of 
                           me, but I fail to see what’s so 
                           glamorous about lost promise. 
                           ‘Distinguished’ for what? For doing 
                           nothing for a long time in the same 
                           place.
                                     VICTOR
                           Please God, don’t say that -
                                     ANNE2
                           The only one I like is PATRICK1... 
        21      EXT. TERRACE/DRIVEWAY, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 1967 - DAY     21
                YOUNG PATRICK runs full pelt towards his mother. 
                                     ANNE (V.O.)
                           At least he still has a little life 
                           in him -
      Patrick Melrose - 'Never Mind' - Ep 2                               10
                Stepping outside, ELEANOR shields her eyes from the morning 
                blaze.
                                     ELEANOR
                           PATRICK2, where on earth have you 
                           been? DAVID1’s been calling.
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                           Can we play now?
                                     ELEANOR2
                           Not now - 
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                           But you said we could -
                                     ELEANOR2
                           Darling, I have to pick NICHOLAS1 up 
                           from the airport, there’s nothing I 
                           can do about it - 
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                           You promised!
                                     ELEANOR2
                           Au revoir! A bientot!
                A beat, and YOUNG PATRICK2 follows after ELEANOR2.
                A beautiful maroon BUICK parked beneath a pine tree. Pure 
                Americana, bizarre in this setting. She sets about wiping 
                resin from the windscreen.
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                           Can I come with you then? 
                                     ELEANOR2
                           No! DAVID1 wants you here with 
                           him. 
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                           I’ll stay in the car, I won’t say a 
                           word.
                A moment, and she kneels, takes his hand. 
                                     ELEANOR2
                           It sounds strange but DAVID1 
                           gets jealous. DAVID1 thinks it’s very 
                           important that you’re not too  
                           dependant on me. You mustn’t prefer 
                           my company to his. 
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                           I do.

                                     ELEANOR2
                           Well you mustn’t let on. Please, 
                           not that look -
                               (a kiss on the forehead)
                           If you’re nice to DAVID1, then you can 
                           come and find me before dinner, 
                           tell me about your day and I’ll 
                           tell you about mine and I promise, 
                           I swear, you will have my full 
                           attention.
                She sees ANNE2 and VICTOR arrive, and switches into her

                           Ah, here you are! You’re just in 
                           time. I hope you’re comfortable in 
                           the cottage. I’d have put you in 
                           the house but you know how DAVID1 
                           hates having to share anything with 
                           anyone, even air. At dinner, he’ll 
                           be all over you, I’m sure.
                                     ANNE2
                           Patrick, are you coming with us? I 
                           do hope so! 
                                     ELEANOR2
                           No! No, American girls only, I’m 
                           afraid. 
                             ANNE2                      ELEANOR2 (CONT'D)
                I’m sure we could make an        Victor, aren’t you terribly 
                excepti-                         hot? Have you finished 
                                                 writing your book?
                VICTOR puffs up, pleased to be fulfilling his role.
                                     VICTOR
                           Not quite. Identity is such a big 
                           subject and -  
                                     ELEANOR2
                           Forget it, you’ve already lost me, 
                           Victor - 
                And in fumbling for the keys, she drops her bag. Bottles of 
                pills roll out, along with a hip-flask. ANNE2 notes them, 
                alarmed. Inside the car -
                                     ANNE2
                           Perhaps I should drive. 
                                     ELEANOR2
                           No-one else can drive this car! 
                           It’s the one thing that’s still 
                           mine alone.

                           But it is rather a long way. 
                                     ELEANOR2
                           Not the way I drive. 
                And with a look of terrible trepidation, ANNE2 climbs in the 
                car, leaving YOUNG PATRICK2 and VICTOR awkwardly alone.
                VICTOR is not a natural with children.
                YOUNG PATRICK2 is not a natural with adults.
                                     VICTOR
                           Well, young man, what have you been 
                           up to -
                The car leaves. YOUNG PATRICK2 turns and walks away. From the 
                house, the sound of the piano.
        22      INT. HALLWAY, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 1967 - DAY              22
                The house is cool after the morning sun. There’s a pause in 
                the music, then a new melody. The piece of music we’ve heard 
                before, Patrick’s theme. He peeks somewhat nervously into the 
                room -
                                     DAVID2 (O.S.)
                           I know you’re there. 
                YOUNG PATRICK2 enters -
        23      INT. DRAWING ROOM, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 1967 - DAY         23
                                     DAVID2
                           Hello, Mr. PATRICK2. Have they 
                           all gone?
                               (YOUNG PATRICK2 nods)
                           Good. We’ll have our special day. 
                           Recognise this? 
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                           You wrote it for me. 
                And YOUNG PATRICK2 steps forward, a little more at ease.
                                     DAVID2
                           When I left Eton, my father asked 
                           me what do you want to do with your 
                           life? I didn’t dare tell him I 
                           wanted to compose music. ‘I don’t 
                           know, sir’ I said. What did he say?
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                               (a routine)
                           ‘Better join the army.’
      Patrick Melrose - 'Never Mind' - Ep 2                               13
                He stops playing abruptly, turns, regards YOUNG PATRICK2.
                                     DAVID2
                           What will you do with your life, I 
                           wonder?
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                           I don’t know, DAVID2.
                DAVID2 regards his son fondly. He places his cigar in the 
                ashtray, stands. Into another routine -
                                     DAVID2
                           Shall I pick you up by the ears?
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                           No!
                Meaning ‘yes’. He’s delighted - they’ve done this before.
                                     DAVID2
                           Come here.
                DAVID2 holds onto his son’s ears. YOUNG PATRICK2 holds onto his 
                DAVID2’s wrists. 
                                     DAVID2 (CONT’D)
                           Ready?
                And DAVID2 lifts, taking PATRICK2’S weight in his wrists, 
                giving the illusion that he’s shaking him by his ears alone. 
                They both laugh at the game - they’ve done this before. 
                                     DAVID2 (CONT’D)
                           Now let go!
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                           No. 
                                     DAVID2
                           Let go and I’ll drop you. 
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                           No!
                                     DAVID2
                           Trust me! On three. Are you ready? 
                           1, 2...
                YOUNG PATRICK2 lets go.
                But DAVID2 does not drop him.
                And for one awful, suspended moment he really is holding 
                PATRICK2 only by the ears. PATRICK2 wails, snatches his 
                DAVID2’s wrists, his legs kicking the air.

                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                           Put me down! Put me down!
                                     DAVID2
                           You’ve learnt a very important 
                           lesson today. Think for yourself. 
                           Never let other people make 
                           important decisions for you. Do you 
                           understand? Understand!
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                           Yes!
                               (he drops him)
                           You lied! You hurt me!
                                     DAVID2
                           And don’t whimper. It’s very 
                           unattractive. 
                YOUNG PATRICK2 escapes from the room - 
                And for a moment, DAVID2’s supreme control falters. Regret, a 
                kind of petulant remorse battles with his fury at his son’s 
                departure. His breathing becomes a little more ragged.
                He takes up his cigar, puts his hand to the keyboard, winces - 
                                     NICHOLAS2 (V.O.)
                           Of course DAVID1 doesn’t have a 
                           penny. His terrible father cut him 
                           off. Left him nothing but a pair of 
                           old pyjamas -
                His fingers are twisted and curled like talons. He rubs at 
                them, and stands sharply -

                NICHOLAS2, slumped in the back of the black-cab, 
                conservatively dressed in striped shirt, a panama hat pulled

                           Daring to defy DAVID1becoming a 
                           doctor. Before that, he wanted to 
                           be a composer. Could’ve too. Don’t 
                           stare at his hands.

                ELEANOR2’s uppers are kicking in, and she drives with manic 
                ebullience through the vineyards. ANNE2 clings on -

                           ELEANOR1, on the other hand, comes 
                           from one of the richest families in 
                           America. All new money of course, 
                           from the patent on a dry-cleaning 
                           fluid, but completely loaded. She 
                           was quite a catch, young ELEANOR1, 
                           for someone like DAVID1.

                           Of course she wasn’t drunk in those 
                           days, just very shy and nervous -
        27      EXT. TERRACE, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 1967 - DAY              27
                A reprise of the earlier shot - a fat, juicy FIG rots. 
                DAVID stalks out of the drawing room and across the terrace, 
                his fingers tensing and twisting in pain and fury.
                                     NICHOLAS2 (V.O.)
                           The house was the first thing DAVID1 
                           persuaded ELEANOR1 to buy. First summer 
                           there, we were sitting on the 
                           terrace and ELEANOR1 complained about 
                           the terrible waste of figs which 
                           fell from the tree and rotted there 
                           when there were people starving in 
                           the world!
                Standing on the Terrace, DAVID2 sees PATRICK2 running, running 
                away from him through the vineyard. A look of cold fury.
                                     NICHOLAS2 (V.O.)
                           I saw a look come over DAVID1’s face 
                           - Christ, I hope you never get to 
                           see it. There were a lot of figs on 
                           the ground, some of them old and 
                           squashed, others with wasps dancing 
                           around them, and DAVID1 did this 
                           amazing thing.

                           He told ELEANOR1 to get on all fours 
                           and eat all the figs off the 
                           ground...

                           Yes, ELANOR1 did look a little 
                           confused. And - what’s the word - 
                           betrayed. ELEANOR1 didn’t protest 
                           though. Just ate every single one.

                           Why does anyone let themselves be a 
                           victim like that?
                                     NICHOLAS
                           Is every woman who chooses to live 
                           with a difficult man a victim?
                                     BRIDGET
                           Yes, if she could leave.
                           And what about you? 
                                     NICHOLAS
                           What do you mean?
                                     BRIDGET
                           Why are you so loyal to someone 
                           who’s not even nice?
                                     NICHOLAS
                           Why on earth should he be nice? 
                           David Melrose is part of the world 
                           that matters, and you’ll find, 
                           young lady, in the course of your 
                           life that such people, though often 
                           destructive and cruel, possess a 
                           vitality that makes other people 
                           seem dull by comparison.
                                     BRIDGET

                           If I wanted nice we’d be at your 
                           mother’s, quietly praying for 
                           easeful death.

        30      INT/EXT. BUICK, COUNTRY ROAD, PROVENCE 1967 - DAY          30
                The BUICK has come to a halt behind a tractor. In the 
                vineyards, WORKERS picking the grapes. 
                                     ELEANOR2
                           Now that’s a meaningful life -
                               (the GRAPE-PICKERS)
                           Like a Red Indian or something. 
                           Rising with the sun, living off the 
                           land, connected to the earth, and 
                           if you want a chicken, you have to 
                           strangle it yourself. 
                                     ANNE2
                           Sounds idyllic.
                                     ELEANOR2
                           This is so frustrating. 
                               (beeping the horn)
                           I wanted to stop for lunch!
                The horn blares. ANNE2, endeavouring to talk her down - 
                                     ANNE2
                           So is PATRICK1 looking forward to 
                           going back to school?
                                     ELEANOR2
                           Why do people imagine they’ll 
                           please me by asking about PATRICK1? 
                           I don’t know how he is, only he 
                           knows - 
                                     ANNE2
                           I’m sorry, I thought - 
                                     ELEANOR2
                           If you want to see him, he’ll be 
                           lurking tonight. Oh, God. Tonight. 
                           I need a drink.
                And without checking the road ahead, she jams the Buick into 
                gear and blindly pulls out past the tractor. ANNE2 covers her 
                eyes and cries out -

        31      EXT. RESTAURANT, SIGNES, SOUTH OF FRANCE 1967 - DAY        31
                The BUICK pulls up and parks in a random fashion in the 
                square of an idyllic village. ELEANOR2 stumbles out, ANNE2 
                shaken, follows. 
                                     ELEANOR2
                           Ah this is the place! Isn’t it 
                           lovely? There’s Marcel! Marcel!
                               (a hunched, seedy looking 
                                man is dropping cigarette 
                                ash on the table.)
                           After the war the Nazis shot every 
                           man in the village except Marcel, 
                           which is lucky for us because the 
                           food is wonderful.
        32      EXT. RESTAURANT, SIGNES, SOUTH OF FRANCE 1967 - DAY        32
                But it isn’t wonderful, it’s a terrible dark, gristly stew. 
                ELEANOR2 has her eyes closed, her head nodding forward into 
                her plate.
                                     ELEANOR2
                           Isn’t this fun? American..girls...
                                     ANNE2
                           Hey. Hey, wake-up!
                                     ELEANOR2
                               (eyes closed)
                           I am awake. I’m awake. You know 
                           what I need? A cognac -
                                     ANNE2
                           That’s not a good idea. 
                                     ELEANOR2
                               (reaching into her bag)
                           Of course it is -
                               (a pill bottle)
                           It’s exactly what we need after all 
                           this heavy food.
                               (shaking out Dexedrine)
                           For my headache.
                               (to MARCEL)
                           Deux cognacs, Marcel!
                                     ANNE2
                           May I speak frankly?
                                     ELEANOR2
                               (paying the bill)
                           I do hate it when people say that.

                                     ANNE2
                           Do you think perhaps you’re 
                           drinking a little too much? 
                                     ELEANOR2
                           Too much for what?
                                     ANNE2
                           For lunch, for your own good. For 
                           PATRICK1’s.
                               (ELEANOR2 opens her eyes 
                                now)
                           Obviously, it’s never possible to 
                           know exactly what goes on in a 
                           family -  
                                     ELEANOR2
                           No, it is not, especially when you 
                           are neither married nor have 
                           children yourself - 
                               (the cognac arrives)
                           Merci, Marcel. 
                She takes the pill, washes it down with the cognac, then 
                starts to walk away. ANNE2 follows.
                                     ELEANOR2 (CONT’D)
                               (to herself)
                           Extraordinary remark.
                               (then she stumbles, 
                                steadies herself. ANNE2 
                                reaches out. )
                           Here. Seeing as you’re so concerned 
                           about my  welfare -

                ANNE drives, ELEANOR reclines in the seat, her eyes 
                flickering. 
                From ELEANOR’s POV we see the wonderful countryside passing 
                by, the colours now as vivid and stylised as a Van Gogh.

                FORWARD to LONDON 1982, the Westway from Heathrow, grey and 
                suburban. PATRICK lies curled in the back of JOHNNY’s car, 
                shaking and sweating - the start of withdrawal.  
                                     PATRICK

                stands slashing at the vines that cover the entrance.

                DAVID ends the music with a facetious cha-cha-cha. DAVID 
                examines his hands. Away from the keyboard, his fingers are 
                cramped with rheumatism. Not long now, and they’ll be 
                useless. Claws. Hands shaking, he unscrews the lid of a 
                bottle of pills, swallows one with pastis.
                He recalls PATRICK’s rejection. A spasm of anger. He goes 
                quickly to the window -

                ANNE turns on the radio - French pop - and immediately 
                ELEANOR springs instantly into life. Some neural switch has 
                been thrown. The Dexedrine has kicked in. Manic now -
                                     ELEANOR
                           Hello, hello, where are we? Yes, I 
                           remember. Hello. Goodness, that 
                           stew was awfully rich. I feel 
                           better now. Hello. HERE IT IS!
                They pass a sign. A theme park.

                           ‘L’OK Corral.’ We must go! It’ll be 
                           like going home -

                           Have we got time?
                                     ELEANOR2
                           Of course! Please? Ple-ease?
        40      EXT. SALOON, ‘L’OK CORRAL’, PROVENCE 1967 - DAY            40
                Bang! A French COWBOY is shot and stumbles out through the 
                saloon doors. ELEANOR, in cowboy hat, claps her hands with 
                delight!
                But with autumn looming, the amusement park has an 
                underpopulated, melancholy air, and ANNE struggles to join in 
                with ELEANOR’s glee.
                                     ELEANOR2
                           Isn’t it wonderful?

                           Oh, he’s never been. Look! A Ferris

                           I’d like you to understand 
                           something.
                The isolation has made ELEANOR2 less cautious, more open.

                           DAVID1 wasn’t always like he is now.

                                     ELEANOR2
                           When I first met DAVID1, he played so 
                           brilliantly, he was so intelligent 
                           and beautiful, so different from 
                           all the other English snobs. We 
                           were going to do wonderful things 
                           together, useful things. Of course 
                           he was a difficult man, even then, 
                           but I thought I could turn to him. 
                           The idea of turning to him now, of 
                           being alone in the same room - 
                               (a realisation)
                           Why are we stopping?

                           DAVID1? You seem afraid.

                DAVID2’s room. 
        48      INT. DAVID’S BEDROOM, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 1967 - AFTERNOON48
                The bedroom is austere, monkish. An exquisite, invaluable 
                Correggio painting is the only decoration. Christ in thorns. 
                DAVID2 sits beneath, kneading his rheumatic hands, shaking 
                with pain and rage.

                AFTERNOON
                YOUNG PATRICK2 approaches the bedroom door in terror. 
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                               (in a whisper)
                           Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Saturn 
                           - no, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, 
                           Jupiter...
                And he stands in the doorway. DAVID2 waits. 
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2 (CONT’D)
                           What have I done wrong?
                                     DAVID2
                           Come over here.
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                           But what have I done wrong?
                                     DAVID2
                           You know perfectly well. 
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                           But I was only...
                                     DAVID2
                           Closer.
                               (He stands closer)
                           Do you know who King Chaka was?
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                           No. But I promise I - 
                                     DAVID2
                           King Chaka was a great and mighty 
                           Zulu warrior who made his troops 
                           stamp thorn bushes into the ground 
                           and march for days across hot 
                           jagged rocks. The soles of their 
                           feet were slashed and burnt and 
                           though there was resentment and 
                           pain at the time, the calluses this 
                           created meant that eventually 
                           nothing would harm them. They would 
                           feel no pain, and what had felt 
                           like cruelty at the time was 
                           actually a gift. It was actually 
                           love.
                               (DAVID2 removes one 
                                slipper, then the other)
                           I don’t expect you to thank me now -
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                           What have I done wrong?

                - but I hope perhaps when        But what have I done wrong? 
                you’re older you’ll be           Please tell me. I don’t 
                grateful for the skill of        understand -
                detachment that I’ve 
                instilled -
                                     DAVID2
                           Go and close the door. 
                PATRICK2 is shaking, terrified.
                In the darkness, his eye finds a GREEN LIZARD. A GECKO.
                It clambers up the wall, scampers over the window and climbs 
                along the curtain rod. 
                                     DAVID2 (CONT’D)
                           Do I have to close it myself?
                DAVID2 sighs, stands. We follow him as he walks slowly past 
                YOUNG PATRICK2 -  
                                     DAVID2 (CONT’D)
                           Very well. Take your trousers down.
                - and closes the door, with our POV outside. A moment. 
                Then we PULL OUT FROM THE CLOSED DOOR, backing away from it, 
                very slowly, just as in the funeral home in Episode One.
                Silence. 
        50      INT. DRAWING ROOM, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 1967 - AFTERNOON   50
                The house is quiet. The cigar smoulders in the ashtray, ice 
                melts in a glass of pastis.
        51      INT. HALLWAY, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 1967 - AFTERNOON        51
                In the hallway, dust hangs in a shaft of afternoon sunlight. 
                From elsewhere in the house, the sound of a blow. A muffled 
                cry. An inhalation -

                A BLUR OF MOTION through crashing vines. A figure running, 
                running. YOUNG PATRICK2, terrified, tears streaking his face.

                DAVID2’s clawed hands, clenching and unclenching. He sits on 
                the side of the bed and puts on his left slipper, his right 
                slipper. He ties up his dressing gown -

                very bloody beef and flageolet beans, an excellent bottle of 
                Romanee-Conti at his side. 
                                     YVETTE

                DAVID rifles through the vast array of pills and potions in 
                ELEANOR’s  medicine cabinet. Hand-written envelopes marked 
                Seconal and Mandrax then, at last, a bottle - Opium (B.P. 0.6 
                grams).
                With some difficulty, he unscrews the lid of his bottle, 
                shakes a pellet from the bottle, then another, and washes 
                them down. 
        56A     INT. BATHROOM, ENNISMORE GARDENS, LONDON 1982 - AFTERNOON56A
                JOHNNY sorts through PATRICK’s medicine cabinets. He finds 
                aspirin, valium - empty. The syringe from the opening of ‘Bad 
                News’. A moment. He wraps it in tissue paper, discards it. 
        56B     INT. BEDROOM, ENNISMORE GARDENS, LONDON 1982 - AFTERNOON 56B
                JOHNNY brings water, the aspirin, a washing up bowl, a towel 
                to the bedside where PATRICK lies, sweating, curled in a 
                ball.

        58      EXT. ROAD, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 1967 - AFTERNOON           58
                Tear-stained, YOUNG PATRICK walks reluctantly towards the 
                house. The sound of a car behind him. A CAR-HORN blares. He 
                steps to one side.
                From his P.O.V., a glimpse of that other American woman - 
                ANNE is it? - holding her hand up. He holds his hand up in 
                return, and continues to walk.

                DAVID stirs from his opium sleep. His body is extremely heavy 
                and sluggish, and he reaches for the cold coffee on the table 
                at his side. Then stops - 
                On the thin, 18th century coffee cup there is a design of 
                gold and orange cockerels fighting one another, and as he 
                stares, the cockerels start to MOVE, fighting each other, 
                pecking at each other’s eyes. 
                The hallucination startles, then fascinates DAVID and he 
                drags himself to his feet and looks elsewhere in the drawing 
                room. 
                The same Objet D’Arts that we saw earlier, but now details 
                are pin-sharp, colours heightened and there is subtle 
                movement in the other antiques too - a flutter in the carved 
                wooden leaves, a slight flexing of the fingers of a crucified 
                Jesus. 
                A noise from outside, and DAVID snaps alert. The Buick on the 
                gravel -

                           be late.
                               (a whisper)
                           And let’s forget our conversation, 
                           yes?
                Somewhat concerned, ANNE2 leaves. BRIDGET2 takes in the house.

                           say. Tell me it isn’t true.

                           alcoholics. Which, in a sense, we 
                           have. Don’t touch your bags, Yvette 
                           can fetch them.

                           I’ll find Yvette.

                           conversation? Something other than

                                     BRIDGET2
                           You have the most wonderful spot 
                           here!
                                     DAVID2
                           Yes, just think, with a single 
                           machine gun mounted here you could 
                           dominate the whole valley. Stay 
                           there, I’ll come down. We’ll have 
                           tea beneath the fig tree.
        62      EXT. TERRACE, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 1967 - AFTERNOON        62
                YVETTE pours tea for BRIDGET2, slumped in a deck chair. 
                                     BRIDGET2
                           What a civilised life you have!
                NICHOLAS2 rolls his eyes. 
                                     DAVID2
                           Tell me, are you going to more 
                           weddings or memorials these days?
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           I still go to weddings, but I enjoy 
                           the memorials more.

                                     DAVID2
                           Because you don’t have to bring a 
                           present. One should only go to an 
                           enemy’s memorial. There’s the 
                           pleasure of outliving them, but 
                           also an opportunity for a truce. 
                           Forgiveness is so important, don’t 
                           you think, BRIDGET2?
                                     BRIDGET2
                           Gosh, yes. Especially getting other 
                           people to forgive you. 
                The remark hangs for a moment. 
                                     DAVID2
                           But why would I need anyone’s 
                           forgiveness?
                BRIDGET2 is saved by ELEANOR2’s arrival. 
                                     ELEANOR2
                           How can you sit in the sun? It’s so 
                           bright!
                And with perfect civility, DAVID2 arranges the chair.
                                     BRIDGET2
                           Careful not to squash the figs. 
                ELEANOR2 - a momentary spasm. From DAVID2, arranging her chair - 
                nothing. BRIDGET2 picks one off the floor. NICHOLAS2 tenses.
                                     BRIDGET2 (CONT’D)
                           Isn’t it weird, the way the skin is 
                           purple and white at the same time?
                                     DAVID2
                           Like a drunk with emphysema.
                                     BRIDGET2
                           This one...this one is perfect. 
                And, provocatively, she rounds her lips and eats the fig. 
                All watch her. ELEANOR2 frozen, NICHOLAS2 fraught. Only DAVID2 
                moves, removing his sunglasses slowly.
                The effect of the opium can be seen in his eyes, which he 
                fixes on BRIDGET, a duel that she can only lose. She stands 
                suddenly, crosses to the balcony -
                                     BRIDGET2 (CONT’D)
                           Goodness, look! There’s a strange 
                           little boy.
                                     ELEANOR2
                           That’s our son, PATRICK1.

                                     BRIDGET2
                           You have kids? Wow!
                YOUNG PATRICK. From his POV now - 
                                     ELEANOR2
                           PATRICK2! PATRICK2, come and say 
                           hello! Darling, we’re having tea!
                DAVID2 steps in to view and YOUNG PATRICK2 recoils. 
                                     DAVID2
                           Patrick, come and join us!
                                     BRIDGET2
                           Perhaps he can’t hear you.
                                     ELEANOR2
                           Of course he can. He’s just being 
                           tiresome. 
                                     BRIDGET2
                           God, children are so sweet. Little 
                           boy! Hello!
                ELEANOR’s had enough. 
                                     ELEANOR2
                           Let me show you to your room, so 
                           you can get ready.
                YOUNG PATRICK2 watches as the adults follow into the house, 
                his father glancing behind him. 
        63      INT. DRAWING ROOM, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 1967 - AFTERNOON   63
                Late afternoon now and NICHOLAS2 and DAVID2 smoke cigars and 
                drink champagne. 
                                     DAVID2
                               (toasting)
                           ‘Only the best or go without.’ 
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           Always, provided we don’t have to 
                           go without.
                                     DAVID2
                           She’s very....vivacious.
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           BRIDGET1? She’ll do for now.

                                     DAVID2
                           Don’t apologise, she’s charming. 
                In the corridor, YOUNG PATRICK2 prepares to make his way 
                upstairs to ELEANOR2. Intercut -
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           Sometimes I think I should be done 
                           with it and settle down with a well-
                           bred, well-educated, well-informed 
                           woman whose conversation I can 
                           bear. Then I remember I’ve divorced 
                           two of them already.
                And we stay with YOUNG PATRICK2 as he climbs the stairs to his 
                mother’s room, where he’ll be safe - 
                                     DAVID2
                           PATRICK2. Where are you going?
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                           ELEANOR1 wanted to see me.
                                     DAVID2
                           ELEANOR1’s tired after her drive. Come 
                           and say hello to your godfather. 
                YOUNG PATRICK turns and walks slowly down the stairs. 
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           Hello, PAREICK2. Up to mischief are 
                           you? 
                                     DAVID2
                           Almost certainly. 
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           That’s what I like to hear. 
                DAVID2 is kind and tender with his son, but something has 
                changed. NICHOLAS2 loiters. 
                                     DAVID2
                               (kindly)
                           Everything all right?
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                               (terrified, confused)
                           Yes, DAVID2
                                     DAVID2
                           We know you didn’t eat lunch. Did 
                           you have tea?
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                           No.

                                     DAVID2
                           That’s why you’re so pale. Well you 
                           must eat if you’re going to grow up 
                           strong. Go and see Yvette, she’ll 
                           find you something. Leave ELEANOR1 be 
                           today. All right? 
                DAVID2 places his hand on his son’s head, part papal 
                benediction, part threat, and heads past NICHOLAS2. 
                                     DAVID2 (CONT’D)
                           Dinner at eight. Don’t be late.
                A moment of eye contact between NICHOLAS2 and his PATRICK2, 
                NICHOLAS2, too,  knowing something is up, smiling uneasily.
                Music - luscious strings, the voice of Louis Armstrong -
        64      INT. ELEANOR’S BEDROOM, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 1967 - EVENING64
                ELEANOR’s musical taste leans towards show-tunes, Frank 
                Sinatra, big-band jazz. The stereo, however, is 1967’s 
                finest.
                But the timeless good taste of the house only occasionally 
                succumbs to the spirit of the times, and the LP is Louis 
                Armstrong, singing ‘I Only Have Eyes for You.’
                A glass of champagne in her hand, ELEANOR2 dances woozily -

                           did the first time. You were 
                           practically dribbling.

                With champagne, she pops them one at a time. MUSIC CONTINUES-

                EVENING
                DAVID, in his dressing gown, slowly places his arm into the 
                steaming, scalding water.
                The skin is red, the pain excruciating. Every nerve orders 
                him to take his arm out, but he holds it, holds it - his face 
                full of contempt, rage, disgust. MUSIC CONTINUES -
        71      INT. ELEANOR’S BEDROOM, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 1967 - EVENING 71
                C.U. of the YOUNG PATRICK standing silently in the doorway, 
                watching his mother, in evening-wear now, sitting at her 
                desk, humming along -  
                She catches sight of PATRICK2, and jumps.  
                                     ELEANOR2
                           PATRICK2, don’t skulk! Either come 
                           into a room or leave! Sorry, 
                           darling, you made me jump, that’s 
                           all. 
                Impulsively, desperately, he tries to embrace her. ELEANOR2 
                hesitates, self-conscious about what to do next. 
                                     ELEANOR2 (CONT’D)
                           If you do that, I can’t write can 
                           I?
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                           What are you writing?
                                     ELEANOR2
                           A cheque, for charity, to Save The 
                           Children. Because it’s important, 
                           when one has so much, to give 
                           something back. You’ll remember 
                           that, won’t you? When daddy and I 
                           are no longer with you.

                           Handsome boy. Now, tell me. How was 
                           your day together? Did you walk? 
                           Did you have lunch? Tell me all 
                           about it -
                His father’s voice - laughter. He can’t be here.

                                     ELEANOR2 (CONT’D)
                           PATRICK2? What is it?
                A sudden panic. His eyes flicker about, looking for an exit -
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                               (his eyes flick to the 
                                door)
                           Can I take your glass down? Bring 
                           you another?
                A moment as ELEANOR2, distracted and confused, forgets the 
                question; the fog closing in again. She lets the moment go, 
                drains the glass - 
                                     ELEANOR2
                           What a thoughtful boy. I’m so 
                           pleased you’ve turned out well.
                               (a kiss)
                           I think the secret is not to 
                           interfere.
                And YOUNG PATRICK2 hurries out into the hall - 
        72      EXT. STAIRCASE, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 1967 - EVENING        72
                 - looking both ways. All clear. Out onto the landing and 
                down the stairs. 
                DAVID1 again.
                He freezes on the stairs and watches as DAVID1 passes above 
                without seeing him. He exhales - 
                Then looks at his hand. A drop of blood. The stem of the 
                champagne glass has snapped in his tightening fist. 
                Disaster! Panic setting in. He looks to the landing - DAVID1’s 
                voice, laughing with NICHOLAS1. Close-by -
                He looks at his hand. Blood dripping on the carpet. If his 
                father discovers he has broken it - 
                DAVID1’s voice again, as he returns to his room - 
                                     DAVID1
                           I’ll see you downstairs in an hour. 
                A decision. There are ten, twelve steps to the ground. 
                YOUNG PATRICK2 closes his eyes tight. Bunches his fists - 
                - he falls...

        73      INT. ELEANOR’S BEDROOM, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 1967 - EVENING73
                A SCREAM. ELEANOR sits, frozen, too numb and frightened to 
                follow her instincts, pinned to her chair as if by a javelin. 
        74      INT. DAVID’S BEDROOM, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 1967 - EVENING 74
                The cries continue. DAVID ties his tie.
        75      EXT. STAIRCASE, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 1967 - EVENING        75
                And now ELEANOR finally walks out onto the landing, to find 
                YVETTE cuddling YOUNG PATRICK, kissing him, calming him. From 
                ELEANOR’s POV - 
                                     YVETTE
                           Tu vas te casser la figure un de 
                           ces jours. Où est-ce que tu as mal, 
                           pauvre petit?
                And a look of terrible sadness crosses ELEANOR’s face. 
                                     ELEANOR2
                           Merci, Yvette. I’ll take over now. 
                And she comes and sits next to him, moving the fallen cowboy 
                hat. She winces and brushes glass off the step.
                                     ELEANOR2 (CONT’D)
                           Ouch. Poor mummy sat on some glass. 
                           Serves me right, no doubt. 
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                           It was an accident. Don’t tell 
                           father.
                                     ELEANOR2
                           I wouldn’t dream of it. Shall I 
                           tell you what I’ll do instead? 
                           We’ll go to L’OK Corral. Tomorrow, 
                           first thing, no excuses.  Would you 
                           like that? Just you and me? 
                And suddenly -
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                           I want to get away - 
                                     ELEANOR2
                           What on earth do you mean?
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                           Leave here.
                A decision to be made, a whisper -

                                     ELEANOR2
                           Yes. 
                But a TELEPHONE starts to ring, and now NICHOLAS2 and BRIDGET2 
                are on their way down too. An excuse for ELEANOR2.
                                     ELEANOR2 (CONT’D)
                           I really must get that.
                               (a kiss on the forehead)
                           I’ll be back to tuck you in, I 
                           promise.
                PATRICK watches her go, then resignedly goes back upstairs.
                NICHOLAS and BRIDGET come down still bickering. NICHOLAS 
                slightly rouged, BRIDGET in a Bohemian red velvet dress.
                                     NICHOLAS1
                           It looks like you bought it from a 
                           stall in Kensington Market. 
                                     BRIDGET1
                           I did buy it from a stall in 
                           Kensington Market.
                               (passing PATRICK1)
                           Hello again, strange little boy.
                                     NICHOLAS1
                           Well you look like a medieval 
                           witch. 
                                     BRIDGET1
                           And you look like an old fart, a 
                           stuffy, conventional old... 
                ELEANOR is waiting at the bottom of the stairs.
                                     ELEANOR1
                               (to BRIDGET1)
                           Telephone for you, um...
                                     BRIDGET1
                           Wow. How exciting! Who could it be!
                And avoiding NICHOLAS’ glare, she skips off.
                                     ELEANOR2
                           Imagine wanting to talk to someone 
                           on the telephone. I dread it.
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           Youth. 
                                     ELEANOR2
                           I dreaded it even more in my youth. 
                She looks for her son, but he has gone. Should she follow?

                           Don’t ask people what they do for a 
                           living. Don’t ask the staff how 
                           they feel. And don’t provoke DAVID1
                                     ANNE2
                           Fine, but will you do one thing for 
                           me tonight?

                           They’re all connected. You’re as 
                           good as these people. In fact 
                           you’re better. You have warm blood.

                           It used to belong to some Doge. It 
                           should really be in a museum. 
                           Needless to say it’s David’s 
                           favourite.

                           He likes to rest his cigars on the

                           I’m not so sure. He does like to 
                           have his own way.

                           Couldn’t you have got ANNE2 to iron 
                           that for you?

                           barely through the door. 
                Vodka is passed around.
                                     ELEANOR2
                           Let’s have a pleasant evening, 
                           shall we? Let’s drink to..to..
                               (time passes)
                           Let’s drink.
                They all throw the vodka back.
        79      INT. HALLWAY, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 1967 - EVENING          79
                BRIDGET is whispering on the phone, drawing hard on a joint, 
                unaware that DAVID is watching her; dressing gown over his 
                dinner suit but in the same yellow slippers.  
                                     BRIDGET
                           Christ, I wish I was with you 
                           instead... Why, what would you like 
                           me to do to you?
                Without changing his expression, we follow DAVID as he walks 
                on to the DRAWING ROOM where VICTOR is holding forth - 
      Patrick Melrose - 'Never Mind' - Ep 2                               44
                                     VICTOR
                           ...psychoanalysis will one day seem 
                           as quaint as medieval map-making, 
                           when we understand how the brain 
                           really works.
                                     NICHOLAS
                           Nothing a don likes more than 
                           bashing another man’s discipline.
                                     VICTOR
                           One can hardly call psychoanalysis 
                           a discipline. 
                                     ANNE
                           But it helps people!
                                     VICTOR
                           Ah, the therapeutic promise! 
                               (And only now does DAVID 
                                make himself known)
                           Here he is - a real doctor!
                                     DAVID2
                               (all eyes upon him)
                           Victor, ANNE2, a pleasure to see 
                           you. ELEANOR2, I do like you in 
                           pink. It matches your eyes. Is that 
                           vodka I see?
                                     ANNE2
                               (on ELEANOR’s behalf)
                           Please don’t take this the wrong 
                           way but I find it hard to imagine 
                           you as a doctor. 
                                     VICTOR
                           Anne!
                                     DAVID2
                           So did I, my dear, and I must 
                           confess to stumbling a little over 
                           the Hippocratic Oath. Fortunately, 
                           ELEANOR2’s money removed the 
                           necessity of my living a useful 
                           life. Her great gift.
                He raises his glass to her, as does ELEANOR2 to him, and they 
                drink the vodka. 
                                     DAVID2 (CONT’D)
                           I appreciate your escorting ELEANOR2 
                           to the airport.

                                     ANNE2
                           It was pure pleasure - 
                               (returning The Twelve 
                                Caesars)
                           - as was this.
                                     DAVID2
                           So much pleasure in one day -
                                     ANNE2
                           My cup runneth over -
                                     DAVID2
                           I’ve had a very special day too. 
                           There must be magic in the air.
                And right on cue, in comes BRIDGET2.
                                     BRIDGET2
                           Hey, Dave. Love those kinky yellow 
                           slippers. 
                NICHOLAS2 winces, DAVID2 smiles. A smile like a knife.
                                     DAVID2
                           Do you really like them? I’m so 
                           pleased. Vodka, my dear?
                                     BRIDGET2
                           Do you have a Coke? Alcohol’s such 
                           a crude high.
                Silence. 
                                     DAVID2
                           Let’s have dinner.
        80      INT. DINING ROOM, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 1967 - NIGHT        80
                The guests wait to be seated, ELEANOR dazed.
                                     ELEANOR2
                           Victor, you sit there. No, no ANNE1, 
                           you sit next to... No, that’s not 
                           right...
                                     DAVID2
                           Thank God we’re only six. While we 
                           wait for ELEANOR2 to solve the 
                           problem, ANNE1, tell me, what did 
                           you think of the Emperor Alba?
                                     ANNE2
                               (eyes darting to VICTOR)
                           Terrific. A terrific character.
      Patrick Melrose - 'Never Mind' - Ep 2                               46
                                     VICTOR
                               (to the rescue)
                           Anne was particularly taken with 
                           Caligula.
                                     ANNE2
                           Victor attempted to make me feel 
                           sorry for him. 
                                     DAVID2
                           BRIDGET2 - you sit here with me.
                                     VICTOR
                           But Tiberius killed all of his 
                           family! It’s only natural that 
                           those who are terrified will become 
                           terrifying, given the opportunity. 
                                     ANNE2
                           Was that how it worked at Eton?
                                     VICTOR
                           Anne takes a rather satirical 
                           attitude to the English public 
                           school system - 
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           Does she now. 
                                     VICTOR
                           - but the compulsion to repeat what 
                           one has experienced is like 
                           gravity. It takes special equipment 
                           to break away. 
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           Careful, Victor. You sound like a 
                           psychoanalyst. 
                                     ANNE2
                           And as to the obsession with 
                           screwing his sisters -
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           Well you know what they say. Vice 
                           is nice, but incest is best. 
                               (ANNE2 rolls her eyes)
                           I’m sure I’d have liked the chap. 
                           He did exactly what he wanted to 
                           do. No nonsense about ethics. 
                                     ANNE2
                           Why do you think it’s superior to 
                           be amoral?
      Patrick Melrose - 'Never Mind' - Ep 2                               47
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           It’s not a question of being 
                           superior, it’s a question of not 
                           being a prig or a bore. 
                                     DAVID2
                           What one aims for is ennui.
                And soup is served.
        81      INT. YOUNG PATRICK2’S BEDROOM, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 1967 - 81
                NIGHT
                Meanwhile, upstairs in his room, YOUNG PATRICK2 lies and 
                stares at the ceiling, breathing quickly, panic rising; all 
                the symptoms that we’ve seen in his older incarnation. 
                On the wall above him, the green GECKO. A memory this time.
                He closes his eyes, squeezing them tight -
        82      INT. DINING ROOM, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 1967 - NIGHT        82
                A joint of veal is wheeled into the dining room by YVETTE.
                                     DAVID2
                           ELEANOR2, what a marvellous memory 
                           you have, to be able to duplicate 
                           the dinner we had last time.
                               (ELEANOR2 stares into her 
                                glass, insensible)
                           Look at ELEANOR2! She has that 
                           expression she puts on when she is 
                           thinking of her dear rich dead 
                           mother. I’m right, aren’t I 
                           ELEANOR2?
                                     ELEANOR2
                           Yes, DAVID2.
                                     DAVID2
                               (telling a fairytale)
                           Once ELEANOR2’s dear father had been 
                           dismissed for being too drunk, she 
                           decided to purchase a Duke, a 
                           ‘real, old aristocrat’ on the 
                           grounds that if you’re going to buy 
                           a husband, he might as well be a 
                           Duke. And so the Duc de Valencay 
                           was re-upholstered with thick wads 
                           of dollars. But you just can’t 
                           treat human-beings like things!
                                     BRIDGET2
                           Definitely. 
      Patrick Melrose - 'Never Mind' - Ep 2                               48
                                     DAVID2
                           You agree with me?
                                     BRIDGET2
                           Definitely. 
                                     ANNE2
                           Maybe the human antiques wanted to 
                           be bought. 
                                     DAVID2
                           I’ve no doubt of that. I’m sure 
                           they were licking the windowpane. 
                           What so shocked Eleanor’s mother 
                           was that he dared to rear up on his 
                           Louis Quinze legs and start giving 
                           orders. 
                                     BRIDGET2
                           You see, I feel that so strongly. 
                           The problem with the world is 
                           people treating other people like 
                           things.
                                     DAVID2
                           I so agree. That’s something else 
                           we have in common. Things should be 
                           treated with great care.
                And DAVID2 takes BRIDGET2’s hand, rubbing her palm with his 
                thumb. 
                Too much for ANNE2. She stands noisily, excuses herself and

                back in.

                           ‘What one aims for is ennui!’ 
                She steps on something, bends down, picks it up. A shard of 
                glass. A voice - 
                YOUNG PATRICK2 sits on the bottom of the stairs
                                     ANNE2 (CONT’D)
                           Hello, PATRICK2. 
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                           I broke a glass. Don’t tell my 
                           DAVID1.
                His hand is crudely bandaged with a handkerchief.

                           You look so grim. What’s up? Can’t 
                           you get to sleep? Does it hurt? Let 
                           me see if it’s - 
                               (he recoils)
                           I only wanted to - 
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                           I’m fine.
                                     ANNE2
                           You’re shaking. What is it? D’you 
                           want to tell me? PATRICK2?
        84      INT. DINING ROOM, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 1967 - CONTINUOUS   84
                As NICHOLAS2 goes into his act, DAVID2 looks to the hallway. 
                Who is that woman talking to?
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           ...I gather that Gerald Frogmore 
                           shot more birds last year than 
                           anyone in England. Not bad for a 
                           chap in a wheelchair.
                                     DAVID2
                           Perhaps he resents their freedom of 
                           movement.
        85      INT. HALLWAY, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 1967 - CONTINUOUS       85
                YOUNG PATRICK is still mute.
                                     ANNE2
                           What about ELEANOR1? Do you want 
                           to tell ELEANOR1?
                               (he nods)
                           I’ll go and get her. We’ll be back 
                           right away, I promise. 
                ANNE2 gets up and walks towards the dining room
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                           I don’t believe you.
                               (ANNE2 turns)
                           You say you will but you won’t. 
                                     ANNE2
                           PATRICK1 - I will.

                           Not since it ceased to be a public 
                           occasion. In the eighteenth 
                           century, a hanging was a good day’s 
                           outing. Everyone enjoyed 
                           themselves.

                           Even the man who was being hanged. 
                ANNE enters and discreetly approaches ELEANOR. DAVID watches.
                             DAVID                           ANNE
                   (listening in to ANNE)          (whispering to ELEANOR)
                Fun for all the family. God      I found Patrick on the 
                knows it’s what I aim for...     stairs. He wants to talk to 
                                                 you.
                ELEANOR rises unsteadily and goes with ANNE towards the door. 
                DAVID does not betray his anxiety, but it’s there.
                                     DAVID
                           Darling. ELEANOR2. I thought we 
                           agreed that you wouldn’t rush to 
                           PATRICK2 each time he whines and 
                           blubbers.
                                     ELEANOR2
                           But he fell down earlier. He may be 
                           hurt.
                                     DAVID2
                           In that case he may need a doctor.
                To ANNE and ELEANOR’s alarm, he stands - 
                                     ANNE2
                           He’s not hurt! He just wants to 
                           talk to ELEANOR2.
                                     DAVID2
                           You see, darling? He isn’t hurt and 
                           so it’s just a question of 
                           sentiment; does one allow oneself 
                           to be black-mailed or not?
                A terrible stalemate. DAVID2 sits.

                           If you sit, we can discuss it. 
                ELEANOR sits. Then, for the moment, ANNE2 sits, fuming.
                                     DAVID2 (CONT’D)
                           The proposition I want to make is 
                           that education should be something 
                           of which a child can later say;

                           if I survived that, I can survive 
                           anything.

                               (the final straw)
                           That’s crazy and wrong and you know 
                           it!
                                     VICTOR
                           I certainly think a child should be 
                           challenged -
                                     ANNE2
                           For goodness sake, Victor!

                           No-one wants to make anyone 
                           miserable. We’re just saying - 
                                     ANNE2
                           We! Because God forbid you should 
                           contradict him - 
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           - that it doesn’t do a child any 
                           good to be molly-coddled. I know 
                           it’s an unfashionable view to hold, 
                           but in my opinion, nothing that 
                           happens to you as a child really 
                           matters. 
                                     ANNE2
                           When it comes to things that don’t 
                           matter, you’re top of my list.

                Saying silly things to sound     Oh, my word, a ferocious 
                less pompous and pompous         backhand from the young 
                things to sound less silly,      American lefty - 
                it’s pathetic!
                                     BRIDGET2
                           Nothing that happened in your 
                           childhood did matter, NICHOLAS2. You 
                           just did what everyone expected.
                Anger, upset. DAVID2 is enjoying himself now. Discreetly, he 
                takes a KNIFE from the table - 
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           Well I refuse to apologise for an 
                           uneventful childhood, or to relish 
                           the suffering at the expense of the 
                           happiness - big lawns, buckets and 
                           spades, throwing coins into the 
                           golden pool at the Ritz - 
      Patrick Melrose - 'Never Mind' - Ep 2                               52
                While the above is said, BRIDGET winces and looks down. 
                Beneath the table, something is touching her thigh. The 
                KNIFE, DAVID’s hand pressing it there. But DAVID is looking 
                forward, expressionless.
                                     BRIDGET2
                           What the fuck!
                                     DAVID2
                           Would you like a fig? They’re at 
                           their best this time of year. 
                He holds the fruit out to BRIDGET2. 
                                     DAVID2 (CONT’D)
                           I know how much you like them.
                A long moment. NICHOLAS2 caught in his betrayal.
                                     BRIDGET2
                           I’ll need a knife. 
                DAVID smiles. And ANNE stands. 
                                     ANNE2
                           I’m sorry, I’ve tried, but I can’t 
                           do this anymore.
                               (she stands. To NICHOLAS2)
                           You - you’re a pompous, silly 
                           little sycophant. And you -
                               (BRIDGET2)
                           - you should know better. 
                ELEANOR2, meanwhile, has retreated still further, and is 
                muttering to herself, practicing stock phrases. ‘Must you go? 
                Please don’t go’ DAVID2, impassive, unpacks a cigar.
                                     ANNE2 (CONT’D)
                           The only thing in your favour is 
                           that you frighten him -

                           That aside, you’re a failure. I’m 
                           sure you have all kinds of excuses 
                           and justifications for your 
                           mediocrity, but there’s nothing 
                           romantic or glamorous about it. 
                           It’s your son I feel sorry for, and 
                           if I had my way -

                                the point?’)

                           never want -

                           No, no, I’ll come with you. Must 
                           get up early and finish my book.

                           ELEANOR2, PATRICK1 is in the hallway. 
                           He is sad and he is lonely and 
                           scared. I promised I’d bring you 
                           with me. Will you come and find out 
                           what has happened?
                A long moment. DAVID2 lights his cigar, nonchalant.
                                     ANNE2 (CONT’D)
                           Eleanor? Please?
                ELEANOR2 stands -

                           ELEANOR2.
                And finds the words -
                                     ELEANOR2
                           Must you leave so soon?
                Then sits. DAVID2 has won.
                                     DAVID2
                           I hope you’ll forgive me if I don’t 
                           wave goodbye.

                           Almost nothing is as entertaining 
                           as the contortions of a clever 
                           Jewish snob.
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           Very broad-minded of you to have 
                           one in the house at all -
                And now BRIDGET2 has had enough. 
                                     BRIDGET2
                           Oh do fuck off, the pair of you.
                And she too stands and leaves.
        87      INT. HALLWAY, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 1967 - CONTINUOUS       87
                YOUNG PATRICK’s P.O.V, peering through the stair-rods as ANNE 
                takes VICTOR’s hand and whispers -
      Patrick Melrose - 'Never Mind' - Ep 2                               54
                                     ANNE2
                           Thank you. 
                                     VICTOR
                           No, you were right. In the end one 
                           must oppose cruelty, even if only 
                           by refusing to take part.
                                     ANNE2
                           Why are we whispering? 
                                     VICTOR
                           I have no idea!
                                     ANNE2
                               (leaving, remembering)
                           One moment. 
                ANNE turns and heads to the stairs. YOUNG PATRICK1 backs away 
                into the shadows.
                                     ANNE2 (CONT’D)
                           PATRICK1? PATRICK1, it’s only me!
                She walks up the stairs a little, peers into the darkness of 
                the landing. No sign of him. 
                                     ANNE2 (CONT’D)
                           He must have gone to bed. Oh well.
                But on the landing, YOUNG PATRICK2 watches...

                BRIDGET speaks in a low-voice on the phone, throwing her 
                clothes into a suitcase. 
                                     BRIDGET
                           One-thirty, outside the village 
                           church. Barry, you are saving my 
                           life.

                And tip-toes towards the terrace where, smoking cigars and 
                drinking brandy, DAVID1 listens as NICHOLAS1 entertains.
                                     DAVID1
                           I’m not familiar with the house of 
                           Watson-Scott.
      Patrick Melrose - 'Never Mind' - Ep 2                               55
                                     NICHOLAS1
                           They’re terribly Old Vicarage. 
                           Desperate to get Bridget into 
                           Country Life. Mother’s ‘keen on 
                           roses’, daddy likes the gee-gees. I 
                           took them to Covent Garden to see 
                           Le Nozze di Figaro, and when the 
                           conductor took to the podium, 
                           Rodney Watson-Scott said ‘They’re 
                           under starter’s orders...’ 
                DAVID laughs, BRIDGET curses and escapes unseen until she 
                sees the strangest sight - ELEANOR’s BUICK, all lit-up and 
                filled with smoke, blaring French pop music. 
        91      INT/EXT. BUICK, TERRACE, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 1967 - NIGHT91
                ELEANOR sits in her dressing-gown, drunk and high, smoking  
                Players and drinking cognac. 
                From ELEANOR’s POV, through the haze she sees BRIDGET 
                hobbling down the drive and away. She raises her hand in 
                farewell. ELEANOR waves back.  
        92      EXT. CHURCH, LACOSTE 1967 - NIGHT                          92
                And now the clock strikes two, and BRIDGET stands shivering 
                in her mini-skirt. Headlights - a car. Hope! But it drives 
                on.
                                     BRIDGET
                           Oh, Barry. 
                No use. He’s not coming. She starts to walk down the hill. 
        93      INT/EXT. BUICK, TERRACE, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 1967 - NIGHT93
                ELEANOR’s private party in the smoky car continues as BRIDGET 
                returns, hobbling on blistered feet with a defeated air.
                ELEANOR winds down the window - 
                                     ELEANOR2
                           You see? It’s not as easy as you 
                           think!
                And BRIDGET2 hobbles back to the house. A track comes on the 
                car radio. Jagged, minor key; Season of the Witch perhaps, 
                the Julie Driscoll cover version. ELEANOR2 turns up the 
                volume, slowly reclines the seat, cigarette still burning in 
                her hand.

                - and we leap FORWARD fifteen years. PATRICK sleeps fitfully.  
                The worst of the withdrawal has passed, and he lies in 
                tangled sheets, sweat on his brow. 
                JOHNNY sleeps in an armchair. Someone enters the room, a 
                FEMALE FIGURE. She crosses to PATRICK, feels his brow with 
                the back of her hand. JOHNNY wakes. 
                                     FEMALE VOICE

                DAVID MELROSE sits up in bed in the gloomy, monkish room and 
                SCREAMS. 
                He sits, puts his twisted hand to his chest, attempting to 
                calm himself.

                A portrait on the wall, a photograph - ELEANOR, YOUNG PATRICK 
                and DAVID, his hand on his son’s shoulder.

                The BOX with its engraved brass plate. A reflection of the 
                same female figure. She crosses to the bed.
                PATRICK sleeps fitfully. Calmly, JULIA picks up a book, sits 
                by his bed and waits.

                           No, me neither. Must be all the 
                           excitement. All these people. Here -

                           I’ll leave you now. But know one 
                           thing. If you ever tell

                           today, I will snap you in two. 
                A moment for this to sink in. Then DAVID2 leaves.
