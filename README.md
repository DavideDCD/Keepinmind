Python code used to generate relation maps for the paper "Graph-like organization of non-spatial knowledge about social
closeness in movie narratives" by Federica Santacroce, Giorgia Committeri, Davide Di Censo, Carlo Sestieri and Annalisa Tosoni.

# Abstract
Research in cognitive science has progressively highlighted the notion of geometric
representations (map and graph-like structures) for storing and organizing knowledge in
both spatial and non-spatial domains. It’s unclear, however, whether these representations
aid in organizing knowledge from unconstrained and naturalistic episodic encoding and
whether it is possible to identify objective episodic parameters that support the implicit
construction of structural-semantic knowledge. Here, we investigated how statistical
regularities in a movie narrative contribute to the generalization process underlying social
knowledge’s gradual construction and organization. Using the narrative of a TV series,
participants watched five episodes and then performed a memory retrieval task to rate the
strength of social relationships between characters (i.e., social closeness). An objective
graph of social closeness, based on parameters extracted from the teleplay, was
compared to subjective social graphs derived from participants&#39; judgments. Results
revealed a strong correlation between the two and highlighted the importance of physical
co-occurrence in shaping social representations. The generalization process was
independent of awareness of task demands, suggesting an implicit mechanism.
Additionally, increased episodic exposure improved both the inter-subject stability and the
coherence of the social graphs, supporting the notion that repeated episodic experiences
enhance semantic representations. These findings emphasize the role of episodic
statistical regularities as building blocks for the organization of non-spatial, conceptual
knowledge in graph-like structures.
