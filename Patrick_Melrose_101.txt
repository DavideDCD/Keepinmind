                A TELEPHONE RINGS. A loud, persistent electronic trill - 
                                                                  FADE IN:
        1       INT. HALLWAY, ENNISMORE GARDENS, LONDON 1982 - DAY          1
                The telephone rings in the hallway of a rather messy flat, 
                curtains drawn against the May sunlight.
                A figure appears at the end of the hallway. A thin face, 
                handsome, fine-featured, eyes of a startling intelligence, 
                but a certain vampiric sallowness to the skin.
                This is PATRICK2 MELROSE, twenties, unsteady, distracted. He 
                regards the phone like an enemy, picks up. Then -
                                     PATRICK2
                           Hello. Hello?
                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                               (well-spoken, distant)
                           PATRICK2? Hello, PATRICK2 is that 
                           you?
                                     PATRICK2
                           NICHOLAS2? 
                                     NICHOLAS2 (O.S.)
                           PATRICK2, I’m afraid I have rather 
                           bad news.
                PATRICK2 doesn’t move, his face entirely impassive.
                                     NICHOLAS2 (CONT’D)
                           Hello? Hello, PATRICK2? Can you hear 
                           me? I’m in New York. There appears 
                           to be a delay. Can you hear me? It 
                           concerns DAVID1.
                                     PATRICK2
                           I’m here. 
                                     NICHOLAS2(O.S.)
                           DAVID1 died the night before 
                           last, in his hotel room. It must 
                           come as an awful shock to you. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           Something like that.
                PATRICK2 sits dazed, and an object falls to the floor. PATRICK2 kneels to 
                retrieve it.
                                     NICHOLAS2 (O.S.)
                           I hardly need to tell you how I 
                           feel. I adored DAVID1. 
                                     (MORE)
      
                                     NICHOLAS2 (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                           Everybody liked DAVID1. I know DAVID1 
                           wasn’t always the easiest of men. 
                           Are you there, PATRICK2?
                PATRICK2 picks up the object, puts it on a side table. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           Yes, yes. Where is he now?
                The object is a SYRINGE.
                                     NICHOLAS2 (O.S.)
                           DAVID1? He’s at Frank E. Macdonalds, 
                           the funeral people on Madison. 
                           Everyone goes there. ‘Only the best 
                           or go without’ as DAVID1 would 
                           have said. If you want to see DAVID1 
                           and collect the ashes - do you have 
                           much on?
                                     PATRICK2
                           Not at this exact moment. 
                PATRICK2 rolls down his sleeve and watches as the blood soaks 
                through the shirt.
                                     NICHOLAS2 (O.S.)
                           Then we must meet up. Why don’t we 
                           meet at the Key Club? George 
                           Watford’s here, we’ll raise a glass 
                           to your DAVID1’s extraordinary 
                           life. Until then, I’m sorry to be 
                           the bearer of such sad tidings.
                                     PATRICK2
                           Yes, it’s a great blow. Goodbye. 
                And PATRICK2 hangs up. A moment - 
                - and then a grin, a great, ecstatic smile, breaks out on 
                PATRICK2’s face as he laughs and laughs.

        2       EXT. VINEYARDS, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE, PROVENCE 1967 - MORNING2
                A brief glimpse of YOUNG PATRICK2 MELROSE at EIGHT YEARS-OLD, 
                running, running full-pelt down through vineyards, slashing 
                at the vines with a wooden stick. 
                From the distance, his father’s voice -
                                     DAVID (O.C.)
                           PATRICK! PATRICK, where are you?
      
                YOUNG PATRICK comes to a halt, breathless, and turns towards 
                the fine old house overlooking a valley of vineyards and 
                woodland. 
                A doorbell rings, and we crash -
        3       EXT/INT. DEBBIE’S FLAT, KENSINGTON 1982 - DUSK              3
                 - back into the present. DEBBIE HICKMAN, twenties, earnest, 
                opens the door - 
                                     PATRICK2
                           DAVID1’s only gone and died.
                And immediately she embraces him. PATRIC2K stands awkwardly, 
                arms out to the side. 
        4       INT. BEDROOM, DEBBIE’S FLAT, KENSINGTON 1982 - DUSK         4
                They lie on the bed, DEBBIE doing her best to comfort him, 
                PATRICK2 tense and rigid. 
                                     DEBBIE
                           How did DAVID1 die?
                                     PATRICK2
                           I forgot to ask, I was so dizzy 
                           with glee. I’m sorry, I mean dazed 
                           with grief. I wonder - could you 
                           please stop playing with my hair?
                               (PATRICK2 sits up irritable, 
                                heroin wearing off)
                           I need a drink, a proper drink. 
                           Let’s celebrate -
                PATRICK2 gets up and roams the flat; the decor neat, conventional; 
                magazines, family photos, not PATRICK2’s thing at all. 
                                     DEBBIE
                           We could go out and have a glass of 
                           wine. You’re probably not 
                           interested, but we’re invited to 
                           Gregory and Rebecca’s for dinner.
                                     PATRICK2
                           ‘Suffering takes place while 
                           someone else is eating.’ Who said 
                           that?
                               (a beat.)
                           I’m sorry. I feel rather mad at the 
                           moment.
                                     DEBBIE
                           It was a complicated relationship. 
                           There’s a lot to think about.

                                     PATRICK2
                           Yes, and I’m not sure if all the 
                           heroin is helping either.
                                     DEBBIE
                               (choosing her words)
                           Do you think that was a good idea?
                                     PATRICK2
                               (snapping)
                           Of course it wasn’t a good idea!
                                     DEBBIE
                           I merely meant that perhaps this 
                           would be a good time to make a 
                           change. Start afresh!
                                     PATRICK2
                           Yes, well I have to go, before you 
                           tell me to seize the fucking day.

                                     DEBBIE
                           Do you think, now that he’s dead, 
                           that you could be a little less 
                           like him?
                                     PATRICK2
                           Unlikely. I’ll simply have to do 
                           the work of two. 
                But this notion - that PATRICK1’s becoming DAVID1 - is enough 
                to stop him in his tracks. 
                                     PATRICK2 (CONT’D)
                           Debbie, I’m sorry, I’m not fit for 
                           human company.
                                     DEBBIE
                           Don’t go like this. Stay. Come back 
                           to bed.
                                     PATRICK2
                           I can’t. 
                But for a moment, he relents. She kisses him. 
                                     DEBBIE
                           I’d heard somewhere, I don’t know 
                           if it’s true, that grief was meant 
                           to be an aphrodisiac. D’you think 
                           that might be true?
                And she kisses him again.

        6       INT. BEDROOM, LONDON 1982 - NIGHT                           6
                PATRICK2 lies in bed, smoking. 
                                     PATRICK
                           Why should that be? It seems to 
                           imply that sex is some sort of 
                           antidote to death, or that it’s 
                           somehow life in its purest form. 
                           Which with me, of course, it 
                           absolutely is. 
                A cushion flies through the air. Not DEBBIE, but JULIA2, mid 
                ‘20s; smart, sardonic, a match for PATRICK2’s cynicism. Music 
                on stereo; Joy Division or The Au Pair’s Headache for 
                Michelle.
                                     JULIA2
                           You wish. I’m so pleased you came 
                           to see me. How’s ELEANOR1 taking 
                           it?
                                     PATRICK2
                           ELEANOR’s with Save The Children in 
                           Chad, no-one can break the news.

                           Always thinking of others.
                                     PATRICK2
                           Indeed.
                               (glass of whisky, a pill)
                           What’s this?
                                     JULIA2
                           Valium. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           That’s more like it. By the way. I 
                           think I’m going to give up drugs. 
                PATRICK2 is simultaneously smoking a cigarette, taking a pill and 
                drinking whisky. JULIA2 laughs. 
                                     PATRICK2 (CONT’D)
                           You don’t think I can.
                                     JULIA2
                           I’m a little sceptical.
                                     PATRICK2
                           I’ve done it before.
                                     JULIA2
                           Exactly! What’s so different this 
                           time? You’re hardly the Rehab-type 
                           and besides, you like it too much.

                           Well, you’re wrong. I’m going to 
                           get it right this time.

                           Heroin and cocaine anyway. No point 
                           running before I can walk.

                           Please don’t take this the wrong 
                           way, but does this mean you’re now 
                           fantastically rich?

                           No, ELEANOR’s the one with the 
                           money, and she’s very healthy.
                                     JULIA2

                A glass of whisky on the white tiles. Three SYRINGES, two 
                crested SPOONS burnt on their underside, a lighter, anti-
                sceptic wipes, a tie that he uses as a tourniquet. Five wraps 
                of HEROIN.

                Cigarette in mouth, whisky in hand, PATRICK2 takes the syringe 
                and bends the needle against the tiles. Then the next. Then 
                the next. Bravado, absolute self-confidence.
                PATRICK2 bends the last of the syringes and tosses the 
                equipment into the bin. 
                He opens a wrap of heroin and is about to pour it into the 
                toilet - 
                - hesitates - 
                - searches in the wastepaper bin -

                PATRICK stands beneath the scalding jet, the cigarette still 
                dangling from his mouth, woozy from absolutely his last-ever

                YOUNG PATRICK again. The house is cool after the morning sun, 
                and YOUNG PATRICK2 walks very quietly towards the music. 
                He stands in the doorway. A figure at the piano, in dressing 
                gown and pyjamas. DAVID2 stops playing suddenly, reaches for his 
                cigar.
                                     DAVID

                On PATRICK’s arm, yellow bruises, pink threads of old scars 
                disappear beneath a crisp white shirt. A stylish black jacket 
                is shrugged on, a black tie. Stylish mourning.
                A large sum of money is tucked into one pocket, a passport 
                into the other. Battered suitcase at his side, he sits, full 
                of dread at what awaits him.

                           Congratulations.
                He’s with JOHNNY, his best friend, and fellow addict, 
                bookish, milder. He affects the same cynicism as PATRICK, but 
                it’s an act, a flippancy that masks real affection.
                                     PATRICK
                           Yes, nearly the full set.

                A beat, and they both laugh.

                           anywhere. I’m serious, JOHNNY2. You 
                           must do whatever you want, but if 
                           I’m taking control of my life, then 
                           now’s the time. This is the most

                Final call, a fond goodbye.

                           so many things, I couldn’t have 
                           made it without you.

                shivering with fever.
                                     PATRICK (V.O.)
                           Queasy, nervous, maggots under the 
                           skin, litter of drowning kittens in 
                           my stomach. Come on, come on....
                               (a spasm of pain makes him 
                                gasp)
                           Ow! Fuck off. Just fuck off!
                The DRIVER glares in the rear-view mirror.

                           Can you go any faster? I really, 
                           really need to get to my hotel.

                And now he’s stumbling out into the street, hunched and 
                wincing from the sunlight like a vampire. He doles out MONEY 
                from the stack in his coat pocket, large notes, almost as if 
                trying to be rid of the stuff.
        21      INT. DRAKE HOTEL, MANHATTAN 1982 - DAY                     21
                The DRAKE HOTEL is plush, but stuffy. THE RECEPTIONIST 
                smooth, unflappable, discreet. Throughout the hotel scenes, 
                he is a constant, omniscient presence and consequently a 
                source of some paranoia for PATRICK. Whatever happens, he 
                knows.
                                     THE RECEPTIONIST
                           Mr Melrose! Good to see you again. 
                           Your usual suite is ready. And a 
                           message for you -
                A message slip, in C.U. To: PATRICK Melrose. From: ELEANOR1.
                            Message: No Message.
                                     PATRICK2
                           Always eloquent -
                               (screwing up the note)
                           And could you send up a bottle of 
                           whiskey and a very great deal of 
                           ice, immediately please. 
                                     THE RECEPTIONIST
                               (rings a bell)
                           Of course. 
                A tiny, elderly BELL-BOY bobs nearby, eager for more tips.

        23      INT. HOTEL SUITE, DRAKE HOTEL, MANHATTAN 1982 - CONTINUOUS23
                Crammed with chinoiserie, the suite manages to be luxurious 
                and dowdy at the same time.
                           BELL-BOY                     PATRICK (V.O.)
                Bathroom, shower. This is the    Here we go. You know the 
                bathroom light. Here’s your      drill. Another withdrawal in 
                TV. Turn it on here, and this    a foreign hotel room. 
                is how you change channels -     Paranoia, cramps, suicidal 
                                                 thoughts...
                                     PATRICK
                           Yes, I’ve used a television before- 
                A WAITER brings the whiskey and ice. PATRICK doles out more 
                tips recklessly, and finally he’s alone. PATRICK pours the 
                whisky over a glass-full of ice. Gulping - 
                                     PATRICK (CONT’D)
                           Still, at least it’s the last time.
                               (he drains the glass)
                           Or among the last times.
                               (he laughs, pours another 
                                drink)
                           No, not this time. The bastards 
                           won’t get me this time. No 
                           prisoners. Concentration like a 
                           flame thrower. 
                He opens the curtains wide, takes in the sight of Central 
                Park unrolling uptown, leafy and hot, beautiful on this early 
                summer day. 
                                     PATRICK (CONT’D)
                           The trick is not to think about it.  
                           But how can you not think about it? 
                           It’s like not wanting to get out of 
                           a wheelchair when the room’s on 
                           fire.
                He looks down. Thirty-three floors, straight down.
                                     PATRICK (CONT’D)
                           That ought to do it.

                His fingers examine the edges of the window, searching for an 
                opening. A twist of dread, of vertigo. He presses his head 
                against the glass - an uninvited memory.
        24      EXT. WOODS, LACOSTE 1967, FLASHBACK - DAY                  24
                A deep, DEEP WELL, a circle of sunlight just visible at the 
                bottom. 
                YOUNG PATRICK drops a stone into it, counts - 
                                     YOUNG PATRICK
                           1..2..3..4..
                A distant splash. Deep enough. He steps back and clambers up, 
                so that he is standing on the edge of the well -

                           it.
                He steps back from the window as if rejecting an idea and -

                           PATRICK? Yes, nanny? What you need, 
                           young man, is a nice walk in the

                The Frank E MacDonald funeral parlour is a solemn Upper-East 
                Side establishment. The piped Bach Chorale plays, and among 
                the lilies and Doric columns, an elegant FEMALE RECEPTIONIST 
                waits like an air hostess for a flight to the Afterlife. All

                           That’s better. Sorry. One moment - 
                               (gathers himself)
                           Now. I’ve come to see the corpse of 
                           DAVID1 Melrose.
      PATRICK Melrose - 'Bad News'- Ep 1                                  16
        30      INT. HALLWAY, FRANK E MACDONALD’S, MANHATTAN 1982 - DAY    30
                PATRICK steps out of the elevator into a long hallway.
                                     FEMALE RECEPTIONIST
                           You’ll find Mr. DAVID1 at the end 
                           of the corridor.
                The doors close. She’s gone, and PATRICK2 is alone. PATRICK2 stands 
                a moment, frozen, vulnerable and fearful.
                The music has changed. No longer Bach, it’s now PATRICK2’S 
                THEME, played on the piano. Breathing hard, PATRICK2 starts to 
                walk.
                From his P.O.V., a voice, fierce and furious, comes from 
                behind the door.
                                     DAVID2 (V.O.)
                           PATRICK2! Come here! RIGHT NOW!
                And the camera swings around to find - 
                YOUNG PATRICK, terrified, walking along the SAME CORRIDOR.
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                               (in a whisper)
                           Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Saturn 
                           - no, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, 
                           Jupiter...
                He pushes open the door - 
        31      INT. DAVID’S BEDROOM, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 1967 - DAY      31
                DAVID MELROSE sits on the edge of his bed in the bare, gloomy 
                room.
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                           But what have I done wrong?
                Our first clear sight. Handsome, fierce and terrifying.
                                     DAVID2
                           Go and close the door. 
                                     YOUNG PATRICK
                           I don’t understand. 
                He is shaking, terrified.
                                     DAVID
                           Do I have to close it myself?
                DAVID sighs, stands, walks past him.
      PATRICK Melrose - 'Bad News'- Ep 1                                  17
                                     DAVID (CONT’D)
                           Very well...
                YOUNG PATRICK, quaking, sweating, sees a blur of vivid green 
                on the wall.
                A LIZARD. He watches as it clambers up the wall, focussing 
                all of his concentration on the creature.
                DAVID2, meanwhile, closes the door with ‘us’, the camera, on 
                the outside. 
                We PULL OUT SLOWLY, retreating from the closed door
        32      INT. HALLWAY, FRANK E MACDONALD’S, MANHATTAN 1982 - DAY    32
                And now ADULT PATRICK2 stands there. A deep breath, as if 
                about to plunge through ice. His hand is shaking - withdrawal 
                or something else - as he reaches for the handle and - 
                CRACK. SPARKS fly from door knob to his hand. Static 
                electricity. He wipe his hand on his trousers, reaches again 
                and opens the CLOSED DOOR to find - 
        33      INT. MOURNING SUITE, FRANK E MACDONALD’S, MANHATTAN 1982 - 33
                DAY
                A PARTY! A COCKTAIL PARTY in full flow. Twenty or so well-
                heeled, mostly elderly Manhattanites in big hats and bright 
                clothes, lightweight tartan and sunglasses, stand between a 
                bemused PATRICK and his father’s corpse. 
                                     WAITER
                           Martini, sir?
                                     PATRICK2
                           What? No, thank you...
                                     WAITER
                           Mojito? Mint Julep? Old-fashioned? 
                But he pushes his way towards the coffin, and sees - 
                - a SMALL, WHITE-HAIRED MAN, very much not his father. On a 
                table beside the body a sign reads ‘In Loving Memory of 
                Hermann Newton’
                                     ELDERLY MOURNER
                           And how did you know Hermann?
                                     PATRICK2
                           I can’t fucking believe it!
                                     ELDERLY MOURNER
                           Oh, ho! Whoa there...
      PATRICK Melrose - 'Bad News'- Ep 1                                  18
                And he strides out - 
        34      INT. RECEPTION, FRANK E MACDONALD’S, MANHATTAN 1982 - DAY 34
                - and STORMS into reception.
                                     PATRICK2
                           WRONG FUCKING CORPSE! 
                                     FEMALE RECEPTIONIST
                           Oh. Are you sure?
                                     PATRICK2
                           Death transforms us all, but it’s 
                           not so powerful as to turn my 
                           DAVID1 into a small Jew. Try. 
                           Again.
                                     FEMALE RECEPTIONIST
                               (scrambling through 
                                paperwork)
                           But we don’t have another party in 
                           the building. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           I don’t want to go to a party, I 
                           want to see DAVID1 MELROSE!
                                     FEMALE RECEPTIONIST
                           There isn’t any name on here except 
                           Mr. Newton’s.
                                     PATRICK
                           Well maybe my father isn’t dead 
                           after all! Maybe it was just a cry 
                           for help, what do you think?
                                     FEMALE RECEPTIONIST
                           One moment, please - 
        35      INT. HALLWAY, FRANK E MACDONALD’S, MANHATTAN 1982 - DAY    35
                And now he follows a dapper, precise FUNERAL DIRECTOR down 
                another corridor, to another doorway.
                                     FUNERAL DIRECTOR
                           This is the correct room.
                                     PATRICK2
                           Thank you. And please apologise to -
                                     FUNERAL DIRECTOR
                               (He removes the empty 
                                cocktail glass)
                           It’s an emotional time. 
      PATRICK Melrose - 'Bad News'- Ep 1                                  19
                                     PATRICK2
                           Yes, that’s why I took a Quaalude 
                           but it must have been a dud. 
                                     FUNERAL DIRECTOR
                           I’m...sorry to hear that.
                                     PATRICK2
                           Can I pick him up later? I’d like 
                           to get away from New York if at all 
                           possible.
                                     FUNERAL DIRECTOR
                           DAVID’s ashes will be 
                           available tomorrow afternoon.
                                     PATRICK2
                           I see. No chance of a rush job?
                                     FUNERAL DIRECTOR
                           I’ll leave you alone with DAVID1.
                At this, PATRICK’s bravado evaporates. Real dread now.
                                     PATRICK
                           Come on. Let’s get this right.
                A moment to gather himself. PATRICK gingerly tests the handle 
                - no shock - takes hold - rests his head on the door. 
                                     PATRICK (CONT’D)
                           Come on, come on, come on...
                PATRICK enters. 
        36      INT. MOURNING SUITE, FRANK E MACDONALD’S, MANHATTAN 1982 - 36
                DAY
                The wood-panelled room is bare except for the coffin, 
                slightly tilted, the head towards PATRICK.
                                     PATRICK
                           This is it. Everything left unsaid. 
                           Everything that can never be said. 
                           Say it now.
                He hovers, then approaches. DAVID MELROSE2 has been covered in 
                tissue paper, like a present half-unwrapped.
                                     PATRICK2 (CONT’D)
                               (a thank-you to an 
                                imaginary friend)
                           Is it...is it DAVID2? It is! It’s just 
                           what I wanted! You shouldn’t have!
                He pulls the tissue paper from DAVID’s face.
      PATRICK Melrose - 'Bad News'- Ep 1                                  20
                                     PATRICK (CONT’D)
                           Fucking hell, DAVID2. What are you 
                           doing in a coffin?
                PATRICK2 touches the face; the fierce, noble profile, the bruised 
                eyes. The lower lip protrudes as in life, but there’s a tear 
                in it, a line of dried blood. 
                                     PATRICK2 (CONT’D)
                           What happened here?
                               (PATRICK2 touches the lip.)
                           DAVID2 didn’t want to go, did you? DAVID2
                           knew you were going to die and you 
                           were right. What did that feel 
                           like, pain or rage? Were DAVID2
                           scared? Christ, I hope so.
                A tiny noise. PATRICK2 looks up. The window is curtained. A 
                distinctive, heavy ornate curtain pole.
                The GREEN LIZARD, the hallucination, is quite distinct and he 
                watches as it scampers up the wall, pauses, looks to PATRICK2.
                PATRICK2 closes his eyes, forcing down a memory. 
                                     PATRICK2 (V.O.)
                           Do not have that thought, do not go 
                           to that place....
                PATRICK2 punches the coffin once. Twice, suppressing a memory.
                                     PATRICK2
                           Bastard. Bastard, bastard, bastard -
                And then, as if aware of being watched, he straightens up and 
                smiles contemptuously. Bravado again - 
                                     PATRICK2 (CONT’D)
                           Aw, DAVID2. You were so fucking sad, 
                           man, and now you’re trying to make 
                           me sad too.
                               (he walks suddenly away)
                           Well, bad luck.  
                He strides across the room and closes the door. 
        37      INT. BAR, DRAKE HOTEL, MANHATTAN 1982 - DAY                37
                A pill, a martini, a cigarette - the Trinity. PATRICK2 sits in 
                a plush booth in the hotel restaurant. PATRICK2 raises the brimming 
                martini glass to his lips. 
                                     PATRICK2
                               (the Quaalude)
                           Just work this time, will you?
      PATRICK Melrose - 'Bad News'- Ep 1                                  21
                But his hand is shaking. He puts it down again, closes his 
                eyes -
                                     ANNE2 (O.S.)
                           PATRICK2?
        38      INT. HALLWAY, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 1967 - NIGHT            38
                FLASHBACK to YOUNG PATRICK sitting on the stairs. A woman, 
                ANNE, stands over him, kindly, concerned, and takes his hand, 
                shaking with fear, rather than with withdrawal. 
                                     ANNE2
                           You’re shaking. What is it? D’you 
                           want to tell me? PATRICK2?
                               (squeezing his hand)
                           Stay here? I’ll be right back, I 
                           promise.
        39      INT. BAR, DRAKE HOTEL, MANHATTAN 1982 - DAY                39
                Quickly, PATRICK swallows the pill with the martini.
                                     ANNE2 (O.S.)
                           That looks fun.
                PATRICK2 opens his eyes, and here’s ANNE2 now, taking his hand again

                           I’m sorry too. Punctuality is one 
                           of the smaller vices I’ve inherited 
                           from DAVID1 -

                           I think you know that’s not what I 
                           meant -
                               (to a passing waiter)
                           Tea please, Earl Grey.

                               (the martini)
                           For me it’s nine o’clock.

                           For you, it’s always nine o’clock. 
                           What the hell - a martini for me 
                           too, please.

                                     ANNE2 (CONT'D)
                               (she slides in)
                           So, have you been to - ?
                                     PATRICK
                           The mortuary? Yes, the best I’ve 
                           ever seen DAVID1.
                                     ANNE2
                           I don’t want to disillusion you, 
                           but when they give you the ashes, 
                           they’re really just the communal 
                           rakings from the bottom of the 
                           oven.  
                                     PATRICK2
                           That’s good news! Ideally they’d 
                           all belong to someone else. 
                               (he lights her cigarette - 
                                an old friend and ally)
                           When I was young, DAVID1 used to take 
                           us to restaurants - I say 
                           ‘restaurants’ in the plural, 
                           because we never stormed in or out 
                           of less than three. I remember once 
                           DAVID1 held a bottle of claret upside 
                           down while the contents gurgled out 
                           onto the carpet. ’How dare you 
                           bring me this filth?’
                                     ANNE2
                           At least he’s somewhere DAVID1 can’t 
                           complain about.
                                     PATRICK2
                           I half expected DAVID1 to sit up like 
                           a vampire at sunset. ‘Call this a 
                           coffin? The service here is 
                           intolerable!’
                               (ANNE2 laughs)
                           Mind you, the service was 
                           intolerable. They sent me to the 
                           wrong corpse.
                                     ANNE2
                           The wrong corpse?
                                     PATRICK2
                           Yes, ironic that DAVID1 remains were 
                           so hard to find. I have no trouble 
                           discovering them in myself.
                               (ANNE2 smiles, and he takes 
                                her hand)
                           It’s good to see you ANNE2. I did 
                           need a friendly face.
                ANNE2 takes this in, but the admission comes just as PATRICK2 
                is becoming slurred and clumsy. The Quaalude kicking in -

                           That’s why I was so keen to talk to 
                           you today. I’ve always felt -
                               (PATRICK2 is sliding down

                           PATRICK2, are you okay?
                                     PATRICK

                                     PATRICK2
                           Let’s not exaggerate. Just a little 
                           sleepy. The antibiotics. Will you 
                           excuse me?

                With some difficulty, he finds the speed capsule in his 
                coat’s capacious pockets, cracks it open, taps some out onto 
                the cistern.

                He snorts. Winching, pinching his nose - he waits...
                And now the slurring is replaced by a manic self-confidence 
                and energy as the speed cuts through the thick night of the 
                Quaalude.

                manic self-confidences, his face, shirt, and suit dripping

                And now the SOMMELIER pours a little wine, yellow and 
                unctuous, presents the bottle for approval.
                                     PATRICK

                           But it’s not heroin. Shhhhh!
                And the food arrives. QUICK CUTS now of PATRICK gorging 
                violently on the salmon and wine with an addict’s fervour, 
                dousing the steak tartar with Tabasco, finishing the white 
                wine and now the red, while the VOICE in his head speaks with

                           everything be okay? It’s too much

                           Here’s the deal. If he answers,

                He dials. The phone rings. PATRICK’s hand is shaking in 
                anticipation. It rings...and rings. A spasm of pain.

                           It got on fire. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           I knew there was something. CHILLY WILLY2 
                           said you might have a new syringe.
                                     MRS WILLY
                           Well it ain’t exactly new, but I’ve 
                           boiled it and everything. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           Is it very blunt?
                               (she produces it from down 
                                the side of the chair. 
                                The world’s biggest 
                                syringe.)
                           No, that’s a bicycle pump.
                               (she puts it away)
                           Oh, alright. How much?
                                     MRS WILLY
                           Two bags?
                                     PATRICK2
                               (tossing her the wraps)
                           Do you have a bathroom I can 
                           borrow?

                The bathroom is even more horrific than the bedroom, 
                blackened and filthy in the yellow light. PATRICK2 stands, arm 
                braced, searching for a reluctant vein.

                           are! There -

                1982 - NIGHT
                PATRICK2 storms back in, broken syringe in hand.
                                     PATRICK2
                           May I suggest, CHILLY WILLY2, that you 
                           invest in a new light-bulb? Hardly 
                           worth the effort, I missed the 
                           vein. Look!
                An awful black blister on his arm.
                                     CHILLY WILLY2
                           Shoulda used the flashlight.
                He clicks the torch on, shines it in PATRICK2’s face.
                                     PATRICK2
                           Well thanks for telling me! I need 
                           new works. CHILLY WILLY2? CHILLY WILLY2!
                But they’re lost to the real world. PATRICK2 storms out -

                - and stride up the street, eyes casting left and right.

                               (in NANNY’S VOICE)
                           Now young man, you’ve had your fun, 
                           go back to the hotel, take a nice 
                           pill, go to sleep and in the 
                           morning you’ll be right as -
                               (- doubling over,

                           Fuck! Oh Christ, that hurts!
                He reaches for support, bracing himself, looks up and finds - 
                A pay-phone. It must be fate. He finds a quarter. Sweating, 
                shaking, he dials urgently -

                           Five-five-five-one-seven-two-six...

                           Who is this?
      PATRICK Melrose - 'Bad News'- Ep 1                                  33
                                     PATRICK
                           PATRICK from London. I’m...having 
                           trouble sleeping.
                                     PIERRE
                           What hotel?
                                     PATRICK
                           The Drake.
                A pause. Unbearable suspense. 
                                     PIERRE
                           My place. Twenty minutes. 
                And he hangs up. PATRICK punches the air with triumph and, 
                revived, breaks into a run.
        56      INT. PIERRE’S APARTMENT, GREENWICH VILLAGE 1982 - NIGHT    56
                RESTORED SCENE. PIERRE steps out of the elevator, skinny, 
                pale, his skin stretched tight. Piercing eyes in a sallow 
                face. 
                                     PIERRE
                           Ca va?
                                     PATRICK
                           It’s a nightmare out there.
        57      INT. PIERRE’S APARTMENT, GREENWICH VILLAGE 1982 - NIGHT    57
                RESTORED SCENE. The flat is large, bare, austere - old Soho. 
                A good stereo plays Talking Heads, something twitchy and 
                sinister, Houses in Motion or The Overload or Born Under 
                Punches. 
                The paraphernalia is all ready, one syringe for PIERRE, two 
                for PATRICK - cocaine and heroin. A ritual, like taking tea. 
                PATRICK counts out the money, PIERRE the drugs.
                                     PIERRE
                           So what was DAVID1 like?
                                     PATRICK2
                           DAVID1? DAVID2 was a kitten, a 
                           prince among men, such artistic 
                           hands, could have been Prime 
                           Minister. 
                                     PIERRE
                           DAVID1 was a politician?
      PATRICK Melrose - 'Bad News'- Ep 1                                  34
                                     PATRICK2
                           No, no, it was sort of a joke. In 
                           DAVID1 world, it was better if a 
                           person could have been Prime 
                           Minister, or a surgeon, or a 
                           concert pianist. Actually achieving 
                           something would have shown vulgar 
                           ambition.
                                     PIERRE
                           Tu regrettes qu’il soit mort? 
                                     PATRICK2
                           I regret that he lived. 
                                     PIERRE
                           Mais sans DAVID1, you wouldn’t exist.
                                     PATRICK2
                           One mustn’t be egotistical about 
                           these things.
                               (He picks up the syringe, 
                                contemplating it.)
                           I had been trying to give this up. 
                The needle breaks the skin, the first time we’ve actually 
                seen this. A bloom of blood in the barrel. Then - 
                From PATRICK’s P.O.V. - CRACKS are starting to appear, on the 
                walls, the floor, on PIERRE’s skin and face, on the mirrored 
                table. The sound of blood in his ears from the rush, like the 
                roar of a jet engine. Sweat breaks out all over his body. He 
                places the syringe down, gasping, hands trembling.
                                     PATRICK (CONT’D)
                           Good God. 
                                     PIERRE

                                     PATRICK
                           Oh, good God...
                He falls backwards -

                - and lies, winded and amazed, on the floor of his hotel 
                room. His heartbeat is incredibly loud, like the blades of a 
                helicopter whirring over his head. His limbs are rigid, the 
                tendons and veins thin and brittle. 
                PATRICK has placed a low coffee table in front of the large 
                TV, laying out his haul of drugs, two syringes, bottled water 
                from the mini-bar. The movie ‘ZULU’ is playing, an old 
                favourite. Rows and rows of Zulu warriors, banging their 
                shields, stamping their feet.
                On the TV, wild cuts - cartoons, horror movies, chat shows, a 
                knife chopping vegetables, a weatherman, a commercial for 
                Crazy Eddie, the channels changing faster and faster. 
                PATRICK on cocaine, pacing wildly. Lots of FAST CUTS here, 
                HALLUCINOGENIC, a long, terrible, exhausting night as he 
                switches between voices, between elation and terror, like the

                A monstrous dawn. PATRICK lies on the floor, the needle still 
                in his arm. White noise on the TV. Warped and distorted, the 
                phone rings on.
                But he can’t move, his limbs still heavy with the concrete. 
                The ringing is louder now but the phone seems a huge distance 
                away and it is only with immense effort that he reaches it.
                Scratchy, barely audible - hallucinatory? - he hears his 
                mother’s voice.

                           PATRICK2, I heard the news. I don’t 
                           know what to say - 
                A crescendo of radio interference, and she’s gone -

                DEBBIE, maintaining an artificial brightness, is getting 
                ready to go out. INTER-CUT
                                     DEBBIE
                           It’s me! You sound sleepy. Are you 
                           sleeping? Did I wake you up? I’m so 
                           sorry, sorry, sorry...

                           It’s five-thirty in the morning.
                                     DEBBIE
                           I thought with the jet-lag you’d be 
                           pacing the room. 
                               (PATRICK2 pulls the syringe 
                                from his arm, sits)
                           Are you at the hotel?
                                     PATRICK2
                           Well, given that you’ve telephoned 
                           me here - 
                                     DEBBIE
                           I merely meant - I’ve been worrying 
                           about you all night and I simply 
                           wanted to know how you are. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           You mean have I taken any drugs?
                                     DEBBIE
                           Not just that. Why, have you?
                He takes in the room, his own condition - a terrible shame 
                and depression; so much for new beginnings. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           Well, I’ve been shooting coke and 
                           heroin all night, does that count?
                On DEBBIE - her disappointment and hurt.

                                     DEBBIE
                           Was that a good idea?
                                     PATRICK2
                           In the future, can we just agree 
                           that, no, it is not a good idea?
                                     DEBBIE
                           I thought...I really thought you’d 
                           be able to make a change.
                                     PATRICK2
                           Me too. But it seems that’s not an 
                           option.
                On the mirrored surface, he notices his right eye. Puffy, 
                inflamed. Oh, God - what now?
                                     DEBBIE
                               (deep breath - optimism!)
                           PATRICK2, you mustn’t be alone -  
                But he HAS to be alone, looking like this. He takes the 
                cordless phone and staggers into the bathroom.
                                     DEBBIE (CONT’D)
                           I’ve arranged for you to have 
                           dinner with someone.
                                     PATRICK2
                           I do not want to see anyone! This 
                           isn’t one of your dinner parties, 
                           Debbie, it’s a very emotional time. 
                           I’m not in a fit state to see 
                           anyone.
                And he really isn’t - pale as a corpse except for the red, 
                BLOODSHOT RIGHT EYE. Shit, shit, shit...
                                     DEBBIE
                           You need to be with people who care 
                           about you, and I’ve already fixed 
                           it with MARIANNE1 -
                                     PATRICK2
                               (he stops dead)
                           MARIANNE1?
                                     DEBBIE
                           My old University friend. You 
                           passed out in MARIANNE1 loo, remember? 
                           They took the doors off -
                It’s all too plain that PATRICK2 does remember MARIANNE1. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           That MARIANNE1 -

                           She’d love to see you. Any time 
                           after seven-thirty. I’ve faxed you 
                           the address...
                And sure enough, there’s the FAX, sliding under the door.  
                PATRICK2 picks it up, scans it - an address, a phone number.
                                     PATRICK2
                           I’ll see whether I feel up to it.
                PATRICK2 hangs up, as DEBBIE continues to talk -

                                     DEBBIE
                           Remember, I do love you.

        64      INT. BATHROOM, HOTEL SUITE, MANHATTAN 1982 - DAY           64
                MUSIC UP - pop music, sharp and bright and inane. PATRICK, 
                livelier now, lugs the TV, still playing, into the bathroom.
                                     PATRICK2
                           MARIANNE1 marianne1 marianne1 -
                The hot tap runs full blast. He sets the TV precariously on 
                the edge of the bath. On the screen - MARIANNE’s face, 
                smiling, sympathetic -
                                     MARIANNE1
                           - it’s so good to see you, PATRICK -
                                     PATRICK2
                           -  and it’s so wonderful to talk to 
                           someone who understands -
                MTV vintage 1982, maybe Physical by Olivia Newton-John, on 
                the screen. Now the huge black pill of speed is in his hand. 
                With a celebratory flourish, he tosses it into his mouth like 
                a peanut then swigs from a glass of bourbon. He winces. 
                                     PATRICK2 (CONT’D)
                           No ice! This is INTOLERABLE! 
                And he heads out to - 
        65      INT. HOTEL SUITE, MANHATTAN 1982 - CONTINUOUS              65
                The main room, where a trolley is piled high with a 
                devastated breakfast - a single bite from the bacon, a single 
                spoonful of porridge - and now it decays and stinks horribly.

                           Everything is wrong, everything is 
                           hopelessly fucked up - 
                He searches through the remains of the breakfast, fishing 
                around in the warm orange juice, but there’s no ice there.
                Punching a table lamp, he goes into the corridor -
        66      INT. HALLWAY, HOTEL, MANHATTAN 1982 - CONTINUOUS           66
                TWO CLEANERS are peering into a hotel suite some way down the 
                corridor. 
                - then stare at barely-dressed, manic PATRICK2, striding 
                towards them, one eyelid drooping, the eye the colour of an 
                egg yolk. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           Ice! Must have more of your 
                           delicious ice, per favor! Room 
                           3318.
                One CLEANING LADY departs, and PATRICK2 peers into the room - 
                a glimpse, a fleeting image, a MAN LYING ON THE BED. White 
                shirt, suit and tie, the face out of sight.
        67      INT. BATHROOM, HOTEL SUITE, MANHATTAN 1982 - CONTINUOUS    67
                Meanwhile steaming hot water lips over the top of the bath 
                and onto the bathroom floor. The TV blares, its power cable 
                taut - 
        68      INT. HOTEL SUITE, MANHATTAN 1982 - CONTINUOUS              68
                PATRICK2 returns with a bucket of ice in time to see water 
                lapping at the edge of the carpet.
        69      INT. BATHROOM, HOTEL SUITE, MANHATTAN 1982 - CONTINUOUS    69
                He splashes in, hopping neatly over the TV flex and turning 
                off the taps. Still clutching the ice he plunges his arm into 
                the water and feels around for the plug. The water is 
                SCALDING HOT. 
                He sits on the toilet seat and looks with amazement and 
                horror at his bare arms. 
                The purple wounds, the track marks, one arm scalded red, the 
                other ivory white. All bravado gone now, he slides to the 
                floor.
                                     PATRICK
                           These aren’t my arms.

                On the TV, WILE E. COYOTE sits astride a rocket, speeding, 
                speeding, over taking ROADRUNNER before smashing into a 
                mountainside.
                                     PATRICK
                           Fine. I nearly died again last 
                           night.
                PATRICK, meanwhile, is in the bath, glass in one hand, phone 
                in the other.

                Curtains drawn against the sun, JOHNNY lies crashed out on 
                the sofa. For once, irony defeats them both. INTERCUT -
                                     JOHNNY
                           I see. Well, maybe this wasn’t the 
                           right time after all. 
        72      INT. BATHROOM, HOTEL SUITE, MANHATTAN 1982 - DAY           72
                On TV, WILE E. COYOTE looks into the camera, face black with 
                soot, then falls, falls, falls.
                                     PATRICK
                           Yes, thank God my father’s dead, 
                           otherwise I’d have no excuse.
                                     JOHNNY
                           I’ve never known you to need an 
                           excuse. When do we two Olympians 
                           meet again?
                                     PATRICK
                               (with his toe, he tests 
                                the balance of the TV at 
                                the end of the bath)
                           At the airport. Bring a lot of 
                           gear. Maybe we’ll finally kill 
                           ourselves tomorrow night.
                A BEAT. PATRICK has never said any of this out loud before, 
                and now that he has, it’s almost...liberating. 
                JOHNNY, meanwhile, wonders if he’s joking. After all, they 
                must never take anything seriously.

                                     JOHNNY
                           Doesn’t seem much of a plan.
                                     PATRICK
                           No. Still, much the kindest thing 
                           to do.
                               (his watch on the bath)
                           I’ve got to go. Drinks with my 
                           father’s friends
                                     JOHNNY
                           Then I’ll leave you to get ready.
                                     PATRICK
                           ‘til tomorrow. Make sure you get a 
                           lot.
                He hangs up and pours the bourbon onto his face, sucking it 
                in until the bottle is empty. 
                Bottle in hand, he lies submerged in the water. 
                Doorbell rings -
        73      INT. HALLWAY/HOTEL SUITE, MANHATTAN 1982 - DAY             73
                The ageing BELL-BOY with a DRUG-STORE PACKAGE.
                The door opens a crack. PATRICK, naked, dripping wet, shoves 
                money into his hand and slams the door.
        74      INT. HOTEL SUITE, MANHATTAN 1982 - DAY                     74
                PATRICK has rediscovered a sort of vengeful glee, Hamlet 
                before The Mousetrap. AN EYE PATCH is settled over the 
                infected eye and PATRICK is ready to inspect himself in the 
                mirror. Clean shirt and tie, cuff-links, beautiful suit. The 
                eye-patch is eccentric, but gives him a pirate’s swagger. A 
                man with a mission -
                On his tie, or shirt perhaps, a dot - he wipes it with his 
                thumb. Blood. He swabs it with his handkerchief.
                Then, like a true gentleman, he takes TWO LOADED SYRINGES and 
                pops them into his breast pocket, disguising them with the 
                handkerchief. 
                                     PATRICK
                           Pip, pip! Be prepared.
                He pulls on his protective overcoat, tosses the drug 
                paraphernalia into his suitcase, locks it, steps back and 
                takes in the room.
      PATRICK Melrose - 'Bad News'- Ep 1                                  43
                It is a scene of total and utter devastation. Broken 
                furniture, sodden carpet, stinking food, bottles and wet 
                towels everywhere. It might have been ransacked by Vikings.
                He sighs, heads for the door, opens it and walks straight 
                into - 
        75      INT. HALLWAY, HOTEL, MANHATTAN 1982 - CONTINUOUS           75
                A POLICE OFFICER. PATRICK’s hand snaps to his pocket - the 
                syringes. With forced casualness -
                                     PATRICK
                           What seems to be the trouble, 
                           officer?
                                     POLICE OFFICER
                           You hear anything suspicious last 
                           night? Noises, cries?
                                     PATRICK
                           No, I was lost to the world.
                He indicates a trolley, being wheeled from the next door room 
                by MEDICS. A covered CORPSE, the CLEANERS looking on. 
                                     POLICE OFFICER
                           Heart attack.
                                     PATRICK
                           Well, the party has to end some day 
                           I suppose. 
                                     POLICE OFFICER
                           There was a party?
                                     PATRICK
                           No, I just meant...
                As the gurney passes, PATRICK glimpses the arm of the CORPSE 
                poking out. The same white shirt, the same gold cuff-links. 
                PATRICK’s own profile beneath the shroud; his future self.  
                                     POLICE OFFICER
                           You’re from England, right?
                               (PATRICK is frozen at the 
                                sight of his own corpse)
                           Hey! You hear me?
                                     PATRICK
                           What? Yes, yes, I’m from England.
                                     POLICE OFFICER
                           I could tell from the accent. 
                                     PATRICK
                           They’ll make you a detective yet!
      PATRICK Melrose - 'Bad News'- Ep 1                                  44
                He strides off, the COP’s eyes burning into his back. 
                                     POLICE OFFICER
                           Take off your coat! You’ll fry out 
                           there!
        76      EXT. THE KEY CLUB, UPPER EAST SIDE 1982 - DAY              76
                Sweating in the noon heat, PATRICK runs up the steps -
        77      INT. THE KEY CLUB, UPPER EAST SIDE 1982 - CONTINUOUS       77
                - into the cool, marbled hallway where he’s met by GEORGE 
                WATFORD, a large red-faced man, unflappable, decent -
                                     GEORGE
                           PATRICK2. Bang on time. Just like 
                           DAVID1. 
                               (they shake hands with 
                                genuine warmth)
                           DAVID1 was very, very proud of you. I’m 
                           sure you know that.
                Here at least, NICHOLAS2 PRATT is sincere in his sorrow.
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           Hello, little man. Sorry for your 
                           loss. You must be feeling ghastly.
                               (on the move)
                           What happened to your eye? Girl 
                           trouble? Now that I’m responsible 
                           for your moral guidance-
                                     PATRICK2
                           Nothing like that. Picked up an 
                           infection on the plane.
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           Well it suits you. Very raffish. 
                           You’ll fit right in here - 
                And they push open the doors to a grand club, Regency London 
                in midtown Manhattan. Up the stairs -
                                     GEORGE 
                           I think you’ll find this place 
                           amusing. DAVID1 did. It had 
                           all the things that you can’t find 
                           in England anymore. Have you had a 
                           Bullshot?
                               (to a WAITER)
                           Three Bullshots please -
                               (then on)
                           I’ve invited Ballantine Morgan, 
                           though I suspect he’s the most 
                           frightful bore.

                           His family own a bank. At least I 
                           think they do. I’ve asked the 
                           question but it’s so hard to listen 
                           to his fucking answers. 
        77A     INT. MAIN ROOM, THE KEY CLUB, UPPER EAST SIDE 1982 -      77A
                CONTINUOUS
                Into the main room - 
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           Here we are - 
                One person. BALLANTINE stands to greet them.
                                     PATRICK2
                           The gang’s all here.
                Gleeful irreverence is infecting him. Fast, back and forth -
                                     NICHOLAS2
                               (moving on)
                           This is Ballantine Morgan -

                               (small, self-satisfied)
                           So sorry about DAVID1. I 
                           didn’t know him personally but from 
                           what George tells me, he was a 
                           great English gentleman! 
                                     PATRICK2
                               (taking their seats)
                           What have you been telling him, 
                           George?
                                     GEORGE
                           Only what an exceptional man your 
                           DAVID1 was.
                                     PATRICK2
                           I certainly never met anybody quite 
                           like him.
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           He refused to compromise! 
                                     GEORGE
                           ‘Nothing but the best, or go 
                           without!’
                                     BALLANTINE
                           I quite agree!

                           ‘Never apologise, never explain’, 
                           that was another one.
                                     GEORGE
                           Yes!
                                     PATRICK2
                           ‘Observe everything’, ‘Trust 
                           nobody’ -
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           All very wise -
                                     PATRICK2
                           ‘Never try, effort is vulgar’, 
                           ‘Things were better in the 
                           eighteenth century’ Oh, and 
                           ‘Despise all women, but your mother 
                           most of all.’
                A deeply uncomfortable pause. Thank God, the WAITER arrives. 
                                     GEORGE
                           And here are our Bullshots! Beef 
                           consommé and vodka; something of an 
                           acquired taste - 
                To their astonishment, PATRICK2 takes the brown, soupy liquid 
                from the tray and drains the whole thing in one go -  
                                     PATRICK2
                           I’ve acquired it! Another please.
                - and any reverence and decorum that PATRICK2 might have had, 
                is evaporating. He’s going to have fun instead. 
                                     GEORGE
                               (moving things on)
                           DAVID1 was very impressive at the piano 
                           - 
                                     PATRICK2
                           If you like pastiche -
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           - and in conversation too -
                                     PATRICK2
                           That depends. Some people don’t 
                           like uninterrupted rudeness, or so 
                           I’m told. 
                                     NICHOLAS2

                                     GEORGE
                           It’s true, I did once tell him to 
                           stop being quite so argumentative.
                                     BALLANTINE
                           And what did he say?
                                     GEORGE
                           Told me to bugger off!
                The men laugh uproariously. PATRICK watches wearily -
                                     PATRICK2
                           What a lot of faithful gun dogs.
                He directs them to the walls, hung with Victorian hunting 
                portraits. NICHOLAS2 is riled, about to intervene - 
                                     BALLANTINE
                           Are you...interested in hunting, 
                           PATRICK2?

                                     BALLANTINE (CONT’D)
                           I thought he might be interested in 
                           a story -
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           The thought you never have is that 
                           someone might not be interested -
                                     BALLANTINE
                           I’d shot a Tanganyikan mountain 
                           goat, the last male of its species, 
                           which of course was rather a 
                           bittersweet moment -
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           For the goat, certainly -

                           Actually I have a hunting story, 
                           Ballantine, from DAVID1. 
                           NICHOLAS2, you know the one - 
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           Steady on, PATRICK2. Enough now.
                                     PATRICK2
                           You’ll like this, Ballantine. My 
                           DAVID1 was a cavalry officer, 
                           stationed in India in the 1920s, 
                           and DAVID1 used to go pig-sticking, 
                           galloping through the high grass 
                           with a lance, chasing wild boar.

                           Very dangerous, these boar, could 
                           easily take down a horse, gore the 
                           rider to death, but thrilling too. 
                           The only blemish on this particular 
                           trip - I heard this story when I 
                           was, what, eight? - was when one of 
                           the party was bitten by a wild dog 
                           and developed the symptoms of 
                           rabies. Three days from the nearest 
                           hospital and this hunting party of 
                           judges and generals decided to 
                           truss up their foaming, thrashing 
                           friend in a net and hoist him off 
                           the ground...
        78      EXT. TERRACE, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 1967 - EVENING          78
                Pre-dinner drinks in 1967, and DAVID2 is holding forth to 
                NICHOLAS2. YOUNG PATRICK2 reads nearby.
                                     DAVID2
                           Dinner was served, lanterns down 
                           the table, silver, well-trained 
                           servants, but none of us could 
                           quite enjoy dinner with all that 
                           screaming. So I got up from the 
                           table, fetched my pistol, went up 
                           to the rabid man and shot him in 
                           the head. 
                               (NICHOLAS2’s smile is 
                                frozen)
                           No cure, you see. Much the kindest 
                           thing to do. Everyone agreed. 
                           Eventually. 
                               (DAVID2 sips his champagne, 
                                relishing the disquiet)
                           And that, I think, was the 
                           beginning of my love affair with 
                           medicine.
                DAVID2 looks to PATRICK2. Smiles -  
        79      INT. TABLE, THE KEY CLUB, UPPER EAST SIDE 1982 - DAY       79
                 - back in New York, PATRICK2 enjoys the disquiet too.
                But the enjoyment is brief. As his fellow diners shift in 
                their seat, PATRICK takes in the sound of music. At some 
                point the pianist has stopped playing Cole Porter and is now 
                playing his father’s composition.
                Panicked, PATRICK2 looks around. The PIANIST is facing away, 
                but from the back could quite easily be DAVID1. PATRICK2 
                stands, knocks over the chair, runs for the door -

                And into the marbled bathroom where he vomits copiously in 
                and around the sink, gasping for breath. The MEMBER next to 
                him is horrified. 
                                     CLUB MEMBER
                           You might have used the cubicle!

                           Good idea - 
                And he stumbles into the peace and quiet of the cubicle and 
                locks the door. 
        81      INT. TOILET CUBICLE, THE KEY CLUB, UPPER EAST SIDE 1982 - DAY81
                He wakes some hours later, nauseous, slimy. He peers at his 
                watch with his one good eye and swears -  
        81A     INT. MAIN ROOM, THE KEY CLUB, UPPER EAST SIDE 1982 - DAY 81A
                - rushing back through the Club, clocking the empty table. 
                Christ, how long has been out? Idiot, idiot, idiot. Then -
        82      EXT. FRANK E MACDONALD’S FUNERAL HOME, MANHATTAN 1982 - DAY82
                - rushing to the funeral home, arriving to find the FEMALE 
                RECEPTIONIST locking the door. He bangs repeatedly on the 
                glass. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           You’ve got DAVID1!

                CONTINUOUS
                The FEMALE RECEPTIONIST recoils - he looks even more deranged 
                than last time as he bangs on the glass.

                I’m afraid we’re closed! I’m     I need his remains! Now! I’m            *
                sorry - if you come back         flying first thing and I                *
                tomorrow...                      can’t leave without DAVID1.                *

                           Also, could I trouble you for a

                           Now, MARIANNE1. I have half a gram 
                           of coke, a fifth of heroin, one 
                           Quaalude, one Black Beauty. A few 
                           lines to get the conversation 
                           flowing, a Quaalude for MARIANNE1 to 
                           get her in the mood. Or perhaps 
                           pity is the way, in which case use 
                           it for the comedown, sleep on the 
                           flight - my God, you’re good - then 
                           you’re home, thank Christ for 
                           Concorde, and JOHNNY1 will be 
                           waiting and - well, let’s see.
                Trotting up to a handsome brownstone, PATRICK2 is jaunty 
                again, a suitor on his way to a date.

                NANCY BANKS, MARIANNE’s formidable mother, opens the door to 
                find PATRICK hugging the BOX to his chest with one hand, 
                rubbing something on his gums with the other. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           Hello, I’m PATRICK2, MARIANNE1’s

                           NANCY, NANCY Banks. We have met. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           Yes, of course. I’m sorry, little 
                           distracted, it’s just  -
                As if to explain, he indicates THE BOX and pulls a sad face.
                                     NANCY
                           Yes, MARIANNE1 told us. Is that him? 
                           I’ll tell Consuela there’ll be one 
                           more for dinner! MARIANNE1! MARIANNE1 She’s 
                           dying to see you!

                           Yes, I turned blue in your

                           We had to take the door off! Come

                The apartment is comfortable, sumptuous.

                           MARIANNE1 says DAVID1 was a remarkable 
                           man.
                                     PATRICK2
                           You should have heard the remarks.
                                     NANCY
                           Was it a difficult relationship, 
                           PATRICK2?
                                     PATRICK2
                           Yes, NANCY, yes it was. 
                                     JERRY
                           When did the trouble start?

                           June the 9th 1906. The day DAVID1 was 
                           born. 
                                     JERRY
                           Well fatherhood was very different 
                           in those days. 
                                     NANCY
                           Yes, perhaps he just didn’t know 
                           how to express his love?
                                     PATRICK2
                           Cruelty is the opposite of love, 
                           not some inarticulate expression of 
                           it. 
                A VOICE - 
                                     MARIANNE2 (O.C.)
                           That sounds about right to me. 
                PATRICK2 turns to see MARIANNE2 BANKS. A husky voice - she 
                doesn’t so much speak as swallow articulately. Beautiful, 
                elegant, poised, kissing her mother and father -

                           I’ve ever had to worry about.
                                     PATRICK2

                           I’m so, so sorry for your loss.
                PATRICK2 puts the BOX down, walks across the room, puts his arms 
                around MARIANNE2, his head on her chest, exhales and holds tight.
                                     PATRICK2 (V.O.)
                           I want to be buried right here. 
                           You’re the answer, you’re the one

                           could have you I’d give up drugs 
                           forever -

                               (looking to her parents, 
                                amused but sympathetic)
                           Goodness!
                                     PATRICK2
                           - or at least have someone 
                           attractive to take them with -
                               (to MARIANNE2, too loud)
                           Are we going out to dinner? Please 
                           say yes!
                                     NANCY
                           Actually, I thought we’d all have 
                           dinner here!
                                     PATRICK2
                               (not looking away)
                           It’s just we have so much to talk 
                           about and I’m not quite ready for -
                               (nods towards parents)
                           Or is that very rude?  
                NANCY bites her lip and scowls, about to object. JERRY 
                indicates - ‘let it go’ - and nods approval to MARIANNE.

        87      INT. ARMENIAN RESTAURANT, UPPER WEST SIDE 1982 - NIGHT     87
                A blue dome, painted with stars; candles, rugs on the walls. 
                The upper-Broadway restaurant is snug, modest, a funky ethnic 
                student hang-out and so not what PATRICK2 is used to at all. 
                But MARIANNE2 is upbeat, sympathetic - her hand on his arm. 
                                     MARIANNE2
                           It’s Armenian, is that alright?
                                     PATRICK2
                           Absolutely. I love Armenian. 
                The BOX sits in its own chair, to PATRICK’s side.
                                     MARIANNE2
                           Aren’t you hot with your coat on?
                                     PATRICK2
                           If it makes you uncomfortable - 
                                     MARIANNE2
                           A little. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           Then off it goes. Perhaps I’ll take 
                           the eye-patch off too...
                               (MARIANNE2 winces a little)
                           I’ll leave it on.
                               (to the WAITER)
                           Two martinis please. 
                                     MARIANNE2
                           One. I don’t drink. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           You don’t? Bad sign, very, very 
                           bad.
                                     MARIANNE2
                           I find it numbs the senses, blurs 
                           the edges -
                                     PATRICK2
                           Your point being? I completely 
                           agree, and I don’t usually either 
                           but, you know - grief!
                               (a silence)
                           Say something, remember how this is 
                           done, something other than lies or 
                           ridicule or contempt - 
                               (So -)
                           Debbie sends her love. Not that, 
                           you fucking idiot.
                                     MARIANNE2
                           Sweet Debbie. How is she?
      PATRICK Melrose - 'Bad News'- Ep 1                                  54
                                     PATRICK2
                           The fuck should I know. She’s a 
                           great girl. Very supportive. Change 
                           the subject. She says you’re 
                           studying law.
                                     MARIANNE2
                           That’s right! At Columbia. It’s so 
                           tough, but I love it.
                                     PATRICK2
                           I once thought about studying law.
                           I used to imagine myself in Twelve 
                           Angry Men, being terrifically 
                           eloquent and righting wrongs - 
                                     MARIANNE2
                           You’d be a wonderful lawyer. You 
                           have to do it! Why don’t you?
                                     PATRICK2
                           Because hard work and ambition are 
                           vulgar.
                                     MARIANNE2
                           PATRICK2, you don’t really think 
                           that -
                                     PATRICK2
                           Me? No, no, no, not at all -
                               (DAVID1’s ashes)
                           That’s what he said. 
                                     MARIANNE2
                           But you have an education, the 
                           financial means. It’s not too late -
                               (reaching across, taking 
                                his hand - contact)
                           - and you’re not DAVID1. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           Of course you’re absolutely right. 
                           I feel quite inspired! I’ll make a 
                           start, soon as I get off the plane. 
                           A new man!
                               (to THE BOX)
                           Did you hear that, DAVID1? I’m going 
                           to be a lawyer! 
                                     MARIANNE2
                               (contact lost again)
                           I’m concerned about the box.
                                     PATRICK2
                           Don’t worry, I think it counts as 
                           hand luggage.

                           I mean, perhaps we could put him on 
                           the floor - 
                                     PATRICK2
                           Yes! Let the waiters kick him 
                           about. Revenge at last! Why should 
                           he get away with it, just because 
                           he’s dead?
                                     MARIANNE2
                           Get away with what?
                A possibility. But his hand is shaking, coming down...
                                     PATRICK2
                           Will you excuse me a moment?
                And he goes, leaving MARIANNE2 alone, sympathy fading -
        88      INT. ARMENIAN RESTAURANT, UPPER WEST SIDE 1982 - NIGHT     88
                Later, Armenian food sits untouched on the plate, unlike the 
                martinis.
                                     PATRICK2 (V.O.)
                           Well this is going well. All the 
                           signs are good -  
                               (MARIANNE2 yawns!)
                           Christ, she wants you. She’s dying 
                           for it, dying for it - 
                                     MARIANNE2
                               (his untouched plate)
                           I thought you liked Armenian food?
                                     PATRICK2
                           The martinis are excellent. 
                He drains the glass, she watches sadly. He’s a mess now.
                                     MARIANNE2
                           ‘They fuck you up, your mum and 
                           dad. They may not mean to, but they 
                           do.’ 
                                     PATRICK2
                           Who says they don’t mean to?
                MARIANNE takes this in - leaning forward again.
                                     MARIANNE2
                           Did you ever tell DAVID1 how 
                           you felt?

                           Not while he was alive. Probably 
                           just as well. 
                                     MARIANNE2
                           Why? What would you have said?
                PATRICK2 is momentarily stilled and silenced by this question. 
                It is...sobering and he is absolutely sincere in his answer.
                                     PATRICK2
                           I’d have said...I’d have told

                           seriously.
                                     MARIANNE2
                           I’m sorry, you were saying -

                The moment of connection has passed now.

                           Good night, PATRICK2.
                The TAXI pulls up. PATRICK2 follows, serious now, no longer 
                playing a part.

                           someone intelligent who wasn’t 
                           afraid to challenge me, I might be 
                           able to get my life back in order.

                You’re making a fool of          Please don’t go, I need some 
                yourself -                       company or I don’t what I’ll

                               (She pushes him away)
                           Self-indulgent little shit! Jesus, 
                           what the hell is wrong with you? 
                She crosses to the CAB. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           You’re right, I’m sorry, I’ve been 
                           an idiot, but please don’t leave! 
                           My hotel’s not far, we could have 
                           one more drink, just a drink...
                               (she slams the CAB door)
                           I don’t want to be on my own 
                           tonight, I can’t be, and there 
                           isn’t anyone else. Just sit with 
                           me. Don’t leave me alone!
                She indicates the BOX OF ASHES -

                           You’re not alone.
                 - and with that the CAB drives off. 
        90      EXT. BROADWAY, MANHATTAN 1982 - NIGHT                      90
                And now PATRICK, furious and ashamed and thwarted, strides 
                back to the hotel, the BOX clutched to his chest. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           Death and destruction, shame and 
                           violence, ungovernable shame and 
                           violence...
                From this point on, PATRICK2 is barely sane. 
        91      INT. HOTEL SUITE, DRAKE HOTEL, MANHATTAN 1982 - NIGHT      91
                - BURSTING into the hotel room, which is magically neat and 
                tidy once again. He wrenches off the eye-patch (redness still 
                there, but less prominent). There’s a manic spite to him, a 
                dangerous lack of control, as he - 
                - hurls the BOX of ashes against the wall. 
                - kicks it across the room.
                In the BATHROOM, he uses the lid of the toilet cistern, 
                trying to crack it open, but breaking the lid instead.
                                     PATRICK2
                           I’m going to flush you down the 
                           loo, send you to the sewers with 
                           the alligators and the shit...
                He bangs at the BOX with an ICE-BUCKET, levering if off with 
                ICE-TONGS. No good. 
                He hurls it back into the bedroom, jumps on the BOX again and 
                again, throws it at the wall - 
                - then finally he picks up the BOX, hurls it at the window - 
                But it bounces off the double glazing, bounces and lands once 
                more at his feet. Invulnerable. 
                Instead, self-destruction. He crosses to the glass, presses 
                his body against it, feeling at the edges, searching for a 
                way of opening the window. 
                                     PATRICK2 (CONT’D)
                           Open up! Open, damnit. What’s the 
                           point of a fucking window if you 
                           can’t -

                Thirty-three floors, straight down to the street. A flash, a 
                fleeting image of -

                The deep, deep well, a circle of sunlight at the bottom. 
                YOUNG PATRICK climbs up so that he is standing on the edge of 
                the well. 
                He tests the air with his toe. The invitation of the 
                emptiness - 
        93      INT. HOTEL SUITE, DRAKE HOTEL, MANHATTAN 1982 - NIGHT      93
                With shaking hands, PATRICK empties his remaining stash of 
                drugs out onto the coffee table, scooping them into a pile. 
                Heroin, cocaine, Quaalude, Valium, speed, alcohol. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           Over-associative, over-accelerated, 
                           sedation, scalpel. Anaesthetic 
                           first, surely Doctor? 
                               (DAVID1’S VOICE)
                           No, PATRICK1. Scalpel first, 
                           anaesthetic afterwards - 
                PATRICK2 sets a bottle of whisky up, a glass, and begins -
                Crawling across the floor of the wrecked room, still in his 
                coat and eye patch he lifts the SOFA and crawls beneath it, 
                the SOFA lying on his chest now.
                                     PATRICK2 (CONT’D)
                           There. Nobody can find you here. 
                           But what if nobody finds me here?
                The sound of a key in the lock -
                Terrified, he peeks from beneath the frills of the sofa. 
                Someone has entered the room. A pair of brogues, a battered 
                suitcase. PATRICK2 holds his breath, terrified - 
                                     DAVID2 (V.O.)
                           Good God, what an appalling dump. 
                           You see what I’m reduced to?
                Another figure enters, the white tennis shoes of a NINE YEAR-
                OLD BOY, and now we are in - 
        94      INT. HOTEL ROOM, PROVENCE 1968 - DAY                       94
                Mediterranean light. Twin beds too close together. No faces 
                here, just the voices -

                           ELEANOR1 will be delighted. I 
                           can see her gloating, when you 
                           report back. Do you report back?
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                           Perhaps we could find somewhere 
                           else. Perhaps we could - 
                                     DAVID2
                           No, we must live within our means! 
                           This will do. Now - 
                               (the beds)
                           -left or right? 
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                           Don’t mind. 
                DAVID2 removes his shoes. 
                YOUNG PATRICK2 is rigid, terrified, doing all he can not to 
                run from the room. 
                                     DAVID2
                           I’m a very tired man. Come and talk 
                           to me, PATRICK2. 
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                           I have to -
                                     DAVID2
                           PATRICK2. Come and talk to your dear 
                           DAVID2. Please...
                YOUNG PATRICK2 closes the door.

                Drug debris - remnants of everything he has taken. Now he 
                prepares a speedball, hands shaking.
                The hit is stronger than anything he has taken so far, and 
                the force of it knocks him backwards on to the floor. 
                He closes his eyes. 
                Fade to black -

                In C.U., our first sight of ELEANOR MELROSE. An attractive 
                woman, nervous and neurotic, here wide-eyed, a little 
                tearful, summoning up her bravest face. 
                But she wakes YOUNG PATRICK gently, her face close to his -
                                     ELEANOR2
                               (a whisper)
                           Hello, my darling PATRICK2. I’m so sorry 
                           to wake you. 
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                           What time is it?
                                     ELEANOR2
                           It’s very early.
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                           Are we going now?
                               (ELEANOR2 nods)
                           Shall I pack my bag?
                ELEANOR2 kisses him lightly on the forehead. He wraps his arms 
                around her and we -

                DAWN
                Slam back into the present. 
                MANHATTAN’S DAWN LIGHT shines through the bathroom window on 
                the bathtub.
                MUSIC UP - ‘I’LL BE YOUR MIRROR’ BY THE VELVET UNDERGROUND.
                A HAND grabs at the rim. PATRICK2 wakes up in the bath. 
                There’s blood on the white porcelain. He sits. Still alive. 
                Just. There’s a breeze on his face, sounds from the street 
                below - 
        98      INT. HOTEL SUITE, DRAKE HOTEL, MANHATTAN 1982 - DAY        98
                Pulling a dressing gown around him, he walks into the suite 
                and takes in the mayhem that he has caused.
                He shuffles over to the drawn curtains which move slightly in 
                the breeze. He opens them and discovers that the window has 
                finally been opened. 
                He looks out at the milky light, at the street, 33 floors 
                below, hesitates, and closes it then.

                MUSIC CONTINUES. All of PATRICK2’s best clothes are rolled 
                into a tight bundle and rammed into a suitcase.

                Once again, PATRICK bends the needles against the white 
                tiles. He wraps them in toilet paper, throws them in the bin. 
                The eye-patch, the spoon, the empty wraps all go.

                PATRICK follows the elderly BELL-BOY down the corridor. 
                Exhausted, humbled, more muted now.

                           Life’s not just a bag of shit, but 
                           a leaky one. You can’t help being 
                           touched by it. Don’t you find?

                           I believe, sir, that’s the common

                           And they shall have a point. They 
                           shall have a very good point.

                THE RECEPTIONIST hands over the bill. An astronomical sum. 
                PATRICK takes out the envelope of cash, takes out the last of 
                his pile of bills.
                                     PATRICK2
                           Well, no-one can say I don’t know

                           Sir! Mr. PATRICK2, sir!
                               (THE BOX)
                           You nearly forgot this!
                                     PATRICK2
                           Or did I?
                                     BELL-BOY
                           Sir?
                                     PATRICK2
                           What I mean is - no need to call 
                           Vienna!
                               (taking the BOX, tipping)
                           Thank you very much. Rivers of 
                           blood, eh?
                                     BELL-BOY
                               (still uncomprehending)
                           Sir?
                                     PATRICK2
                               (a beat)
                           Never mind. Never mind. 
                And with the BOX under his arm, he walks out into the 
                bleaching white light of the Manhattan morning. MUSIC UP - 
        103     INT. JFK DEPARTURE LOUNGE, NEW YORK 1982 - DAY            103
                And now he sits on the leather chair in the departure lounge, 
                the BOX held on his lap. 
                His foot starts to tap, his hand clenching and unclenching...
                                     ANNOUNCEMENT
                           Flight BA2 to London Heathrow, this 
                           is the final call. All passengers

                           to the boarding gate now.
                A moment, a decision. PATRICK2 puts the BOX on the seat next 
                to him and walks smartly towards a bank of public telephones. 
                He fumbles in his pocket, all bills gone now, quarters and 
                dimes.
      PATRICK Melrose - 'Bad News'- Ep 1                                  64
                He dials the number, pumps in the coins. The phone rings, and 
                rings...
                                     PATRICK2
                           Come on, come on....
                               (it’s picked up)
                           JOHNNY1, can you hear me?
                                     JOHNNY1 (O.S.)
                           PATRICK2, how are you!
                                     PATRICK2
                           I’m fine. I tried to kill myself 
                           last night - 
                                     JOHNNY1
                           I see. Where are you calling from?
                                     PATRICK2
                           Oh, the bottom.
                And there it is - a realisation. Unsure whether to laugh or 
                cry, he starts to do both.
                                     JOHNNY1
                           PATRICK2?
                                     PATRICK2
                           I don’t have long, can you hear me? 
                           I’ve decided, I’m going to take 
                           control of my life. I’m going to 
                           get clean.
                               (silence)
                           Can you hear me?
                                     JOHNNY1
                           I can. Are you sure this time?
                                     PATRICK2
                               (struggling to maintain 
                                bravado)
                           Of course. People always make far 
                           too big a deal about these things.
                                     JOHNNY1
                           So what do you want to do instead?
                               (In the silence, PATRICK2 
                                starts to cry.)
                           Hello? PATRICK2? What are you going 
                           to do inste...
