                CHAMPAGNE! Put on ice in preparation for a PARTY in a high, 
                bright room.
                Trays of canapes are laid out by CATERERS, white tablecloths 
                are thrown over trestle tables, glasses are polished. 
        2       INT. BATHROOM, WEST LONDON 2005 - DAY                       2
                April 2005. PATRICK MELROSE, now in his mid-40s, wipes steam 
                from the bathroom mirror. In C.U., older, trimmer, he shaves 
                carefully. 
                A dark suit hangs, waiting. PATRICK pulls on a crisp white 
                shirt, inserts cuff-links, slips into polished shoes.
        3       INT. ONSLOW CLUB, WEST LONDON 2005 - DAY                    3
                Flowers are arranged, white lilies and roses, by a WAITRESS - 
                we’ll know her later as HELENE. Elsewhere, two WAITERS carry 
                a large, wrapped canvas to an easel at the end of the room, 
                ready for unveiling.
        4       INT. BATHROOM, WEST LONDON 2005 - DAY                       4
                MARY MELROSE is getting ready too - putting in ear-rings, 
                applying lipstick. Upbeat MUSIC continues.
        5       INT. BEDROOM, WEST LONDON 2005 - DAY                        5
                A plastic bag full of tangled neckties. PATRICK rejects 
                stripes, spots, blue and green and settles on black.
        6       INT. HALLWAY, WEST LONDON 2005 - DAY                        6
                MARY, about to leave, inspects her reflection, tugs at the 
                hem of her little black dress - too little? Right for this 
                particular occasion?
                She peers at the lipstick. What on earth was she thinking? 
                She produces a tissue, wipes it away.

        7       INT. BEDSIT, WEST LONDON 2005 - DAY                         7
                PATRICK, in black tie and suit, sits at the table. For the 
                first time, a clear view of the setting - a bedsit, sparsely 
                furnished, very much not the family home. Life alone.
                In his hand, a fountain pen and a small pile of white index 
                cards. He stares hard at the card, pen poised, ready to 
                write.
        8       INT. BUNYON’S FUNERAL PARLOUR, LONDON 2005 - DAY            8
                In C.U., an artificial white silk rose is held between the 
                twisted fingers of ELEANOR MELROSE. Another hand, latex-
                gloved, removes the rose and puts it to one side to use 
                again.
                ELEANOR’s face, revealed now, is hollow-cheeked, pale and 
                dusted with powder. Lifeless. One last glimpse - 
                - and the COFFIN LID slides into place. 
        9       INT. ONSLOW CLUB, WEST LONDON 2005 - DAY                    9
                The brown paper is pulled from the canvas, revealing a huge 
                black and white photo of ELEANOR in her ‘Sixties pomp, arms 
                outstretched in a gesture of welcome, of generosity, a 
                champagne glass in hand, presiding over this, her final 
                party.  
                ‘In loving memory of Eleanor Melrose, 1931 to 2005’ 
        10      INT. BEDSIT, WEST LONDON 2005 - DAY                        10
                PATRICK stares hard at the whiteness, pen poised, ready to 
                write.
                But nothing comes. On the blank card, he writes - 
                                              ‘?’
        11      INT. MORTLAKE CREMATORIUM, WEST LONDON 2005 - DAY          11
                - PATRICK stands sentry at the side of his mother’s coffin at 
                the crematorium, one hand on the coffin’s lid. A moment of 
                solitude.

                A reprise of scene 4/59, PATRICK and ELEANOR alone, saying 
                goodbye in Lacoste. Silence, then -

                PATRICK2, in his barrister’s gowns, is speaking on the pay 
                phone, keenly aware of the policemen, lawyers and judges who 
                jostle nearby.

                He pours a large glass of whisky, chatting to a SWISS VOICE 
                that oozes reassurance. 
                                     SWISS VOICE
                           It’s really not a matter of 
                           euthanasia. It’s an assisted 
                           suicide administered by the patient 
                           herself. We’d need a letter of 
                           consent.
                                     PATRICK2
                           She can’t write. She certainly 
                           couldn’t give herself an injection -

                           Can she sign?

                           Yes.
                                     SWISS VOICE
                           Can she swallow?
                                     PATRICK2
                           Yes.

                           Then maybe we can help. But we’d 
                           need a doctor’s report too.
        14      INT. CORRIDOR, ELEANOR2’S NURSING HOME 2004 - DAY           14
                ELEANOR2, very frail now, is turned in her bed. It’s physical, 
                distressing.  In the corridor, DOCTOR FENELON, the Melrose 
                family doctor, visiting as requested, debates with an anxious 
                and frustrated PATRICK2.
                                     DOCTOR FENELON
                           Suicide stems from a disease, a 
                           disease we now call depression, and 
                           that’s what we should be treating.
                                     PATRICK2
                           She can’t move or speak or control 
                           herself. Depression isn’t a 
                           disease, it’s an entirely 
                           reasonable response. Frankly it’s 
                           cheerfulness that would take some 
                           explaining.
                                     DOCTOR FENELON
                           When people are depressed we give 
                           them antidepressants. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           ELEANOR2’s on them! They gave a certain 
                           enthusiasm to her loathing of life. 
                           That’s when she asked me to kill 
                           her.
                                     DOCTOR FENELON
                           It can be a great privilege to work 
                           with the dying.

                           I don’t think she’s going to start 
                           working with the dying, do you? If 
                           you mean that it’s a great 
                           privilege for you, I’m more 
                           concerned with her quality of life.

                           that. I am your son.

                           Hello, ELEANOR2. So I’m just going 
                           to take a look at you and ask you a 
                           few questions...

                           Thank you for doing all this. It’s 
                           really not your responsibility

                           years, I feel complete!

                to ‘celebrate the life!’: ‘There 
                goes the school tart. They say he 
                had a good war, but I know better!’

                made-up. I suppose your aunt will 
                be here soon, an all too familiar 
                face amidst the Aubergines, her 
                vibrant self-pity masquerading as 
                grief -
                      PATRICK2

                Try not to be bitter about the 
                money. One or two of my friends 
                who’ve made a mess of that side of 
                things have ended up dying in 
                National Health wards, and I must 
                say I’ve been very impressed by the 
                humanity of the mainly foreign 
                staff.

                           I think I’m entitled to feel a 
                           little ambiguous, don’t you?
                She stands next to him.
                                     PATRICK2 (CONT’D)
                           She asked me to arrange it, get the 
                           doctor, the letter of consent - 
                                     MARY2
                           I know.

                           - manipulated me, turned her death 
                           into this passion project, and now 
                           ELEANOR1 changes her mind.
                                     MARY2
                           She’s frightened. ELEANOR1 doesn’t want 
                           to do it herself, ELEANOR1 wants someone 
                           to do it for her -
                                     PATRICK2
                           Oh believe me, I’m sorely tempted. 
                           Why isn’t there a bar in this 
                           place? They’d make a fortune.

                           Come and talk to her.
                                     PATRICK2
                           What’s the point? If ELEANOR1’d ever had 
                           anything meaningful to say to me, 
                           it’s too late now.

                               (he turns)
                           ANNETTE2, we met in France, d’you 
                           remember?
    Patrick Melrose - 'At Last'- Ep 5       11
                      PATRICK2
                Yes, I hope you’re enjoying my 
                family home.
                      ANNETTE2
                Oh, we are! SEAMUS sends his love. 
                He’s in your old bedroom now! He 
                wanted to be here but he’s still 
                writing his book! How are you 
                taking all this? You know Maya 
                Angelou says that the meaning of 
                our lives is the impact we have on 
                other people, whether we make them 
                feel good or not. ELEANOR1 always 
                made people feel good. 
                      PATRICK2
                I might use that in my speech.
                      ANNETTE2
                You should! My gift to you!
                      PATRICK2
                You know who loves Maya Angelou? 
                The old man over there, with the 
                stick. Do tell him. His name’s 
                NICHOLAS1.
                      ANNETTE2
                Will do!
                  (crossing to NICHOLAS2)
                Hello, you must be NICHOLAS2...
          And now NANCY2, ELEANOR1’s sister, arrives, exhausted and 
          clearly appalled by the other mourners. She kisses him 
          peremptorily on the cheek.
                      NANCY2
                Patrick, of all the days to have 
                the funeral! It’s Prince Charles’ 
                wedding!
                      PATRICK2
                I’m sure you’d be there if you’d 
                been invited.
                      NANCY2
                But everyone’s at Windsor!
          PATRICK2 notices that JOHNNY2 has arrived.
                      PATRICK2
                Feel free to nip down with a 
                cardboard periscope and a Union 
                Jack if you think it would be more 
                entertaining - 
    Patrick Melrose - 'At Last'- Ep 5       12
          With some relief, he crosses to JOHNNY2 - an embrace, and 
          they’re into their routine.
                      JOHNNY2
                Lovely venue. 
                      PATRICK2
                Yes, I might get cremated here 
                myself. 
                      JOHNNY2
                No need to rush.
                      PATRICK2
                I was planning to wait until I die.
                      JOHNNY2
                How are you bearing up? 
                      PATRICK2
                Weirdly elated. I think my mother’s 
                death could be the best thing to 
                happen to me since, well, my 
                father’s death. 
                      JOHNNY2
                I’m sure it’s a little more 
                complicated than that.
                      PATRICK2
                You’re the psychiatrist -
                      JOHNNY2
                Psychotherapist. 
                      PATRICK2
                Whatever.
          From elsewhere, a raised voice - 
                      NICHOLAS2
                What utter, utter nonsense -
                      JOHNNY2
                Christ, NICHOLAS2 Pratt, I didn’t 
                expect to see him.
                      PATRICK2
                You’re so lucky to have an ethical 
                reason not to talk to him.
                      JOHNNY2
                Doesn’t everyone?
          Over to NICHOLAS2, joined by NANCY2
    Patrick Melrose - 'At Last'- Ep 5       13
                      NICHOLAS2
                Stand by the furnace, or the grave 
                side, and repeat these words. 
                “Goodbye, old thing. One of us was 
                bound to die first and I’m 
                delighted it was you!’ That’s my 
                spiritual practice and you’re 
                welcome to put it in your hilarious 
                ‘spiritual tool box.’
                      ANNETTE2
                  (to NANCY2)
                Isn’t he hysterical! What he 
                doesn’t realise is that we live in 
                a loving universe, and it loves you 
                too, NICHOLAS2!
                      NICHOLAS2
                  (escaping)
                My dear, I never thought I’d be so 
                pleased to see you!
                      NANCY2
                NICHOLAS, who are these peculiar 
                people? Why are they here?
          As they survey the room, JULIA2 arrives. PATRICK2 sees her. 
          JOHNNY2 squeezes his arm - ‘good luck’ - and he crosses.
                      NICHOLAS2
                Zealots, moonies, witch doctors. 
                Avoid eye contact, stick close to 
                me and we may live to tell the 
                tale.
                      NANCY2
                  (on JOHNNY2, alone now)
                And who is he?
                      NICHOLAS2
                He wouldn’t be anyone at all if he 
                wasn’t my daughter’s psychoanalyst. 
                As it is, he’s a fiend.
          MARY2, greeting guests, has noticed JULIA2 too and watches as 
          PATRICK2 hurries over, intercepted on the way by the FUNERAL 
          DIRECTOR.
                      FUNERAL DIRECTOR
                We can start when you’re ready, 
                sir.
                      PATRICK2
                Ten minutes.
                      FUNERAL DIRECTOR
                  (panicked)
                Ten minutes?
    Patrick Melrose - 'At Last'- Ep 5       14
                      PATRICK2
                There are still people arriving!
                  (with JULIA2, a kiss 
                   through her veil)
                Just in time. We’re about to kick 
                off, if that’s the phrase I was 
                looking for.
                      JULIA2
                It’s not.
                      PATRICK2
                It’s been a while.
                      JULIA2
                Almost a year. Is it true you’ve 
                given up drinking again? 
                      PATRICK2
                Yes, that’s all over.
                      JULIA2
                Congratulations. It must be hard 
                just now.
                      PATRICK2
                Not at all. A crisis demands a 
                hero. The ambush comes when things 
                are going well. Or so I’m told. 
                      JULIA2
                Still not given-up irony then.
                      PATRICK2
                Hardest addiction of all. Forget 
                heroin, that need to mean two 
                things at once -
                      JULIA2
                I’m having enough trouble wearing 
                nicotine patches and smoking at the 
                same time. Don’t take my irony, 
                leave me with a little sarcasm! 
                      PATRICK2
                Sarcasm doesn’t count. It only 
                means one thing. 
                      JULIA2
                Quality freak. 
          The FUNERAL DIRECTOR loiters nervously.
                      PATRICK2
                The corpses are piling up outside, 
                you’d better take a seat. 
      Patrick Melrose - 'At Last'- Ep 5                                   15
                                     JULIA2
                           Very exciting. Who’s on the bill?
                                     PATRICK2
                           I’ve no idea. MARY1 organised it. 
                                     JULIA2
                           Sweet. 
                                     PATRICK2
                               (about to react, but -)
                           We’ll talk more.
                She puts her hand on his arm, kisses him.
                                     JULIA2
                           It’s good to see you again. I 
                           wasn’t sure I would.
        22      INT. PATRICK’S BEDSIT, WEST LONDON 2004 - DAY              22
                FLASHBACK. PATRICK and JULIA lie on a bare mattress after 
                unsuccessful love-making. Clothes dishevelled, both smoking, 
                staring at the yellowing ceiling. 
                PATRICK2 is in the process of moving into his depressing 
                bedsit. Suitcases are still unpacked, whisky bottles and 
                ashtrays litter the floor. He’s at the height of his 
                alcoholism here.
                                     JULIA2
                           You’re not really going to live 
                           here, are you?
                                     PATRICK2
                           I’m trying to think of it as my 
                           ‘bachelor pad.’ 
                                     JULIA2
                           Hm. It’s the kind of place people 
                           come to kill themselves.
                                     PATRICK2
                           The thought had -
                                     JULIA2
                           Be serious. Surely Mother Mary will 
                           take you back. What have you told 
                           the boys?
                                     PATRICK2
                               (pouring a drink)
                           I’m ‘away on business.’
                                     JULIA2
                           Christ, it’s all so bleak.
                               (the drink)

      Patrick Melrose - 'At Last'- Ep 5                                   16
                                     JULIA2 (CONT'D)
                           Well, I’m sorry, squalor’s not an 
                           aphrodisiac, not at our age. I 
                           can’t come here again.
                                     PATRICK2
                           No, I don’t think you should.
                A moment. Then - 
                                     JULIA2
                           I see.
                               (grinds out her cigarette)
                           It wasn’t anything after all. Now 
                           that you’re not with Mary, you 
                           don’t need me. I was...structural.
                                     PATRICK
                           Exactly.
                And JULIA sits, straightens her clothing, picks up her things 
                and, without turning back, leaves. PATRICK reaches for his 
                glass - 
        23      EXT. MELROSE FAMILY HOME, WEST LONDON 2004 - DAY           23
                - and, drunk, stands outside the old family home. He knocks 
                on the door. No reply. He lets himself in - 
        24      INT. LIVING ROOM, MELROSE FAMILY HOME, WEST LONDON 2004 - DAY24
                Clumsy, belligerent, PATRICK2 is pulling books from the 
                shelves. He is very drunk, and doesn’t notice ROBERT1, in 
                school uniform, watching from the doorway.
                                     MARY2 (O.S.)
                           ROBERT2? What are you doing in 
                           there?
                                     PATRICK2
                               (noticing ROBERT2)
                           Hello, I didn’t hear you. Come 
                           here!
                Now MARY2 is there. 
                                     MARY2
                           What’s going on?
                                     PATRICK2
                           I’m picking up some things. 
                                     MARY2
                           ROBERT2, take Thomas upstairs 
                           please.

                But we’ve not seen each          Now, please!                         **
                other. Hello, ROBERT2. How’s                                           *
                school? Where’s Thomas?                                               *
                There’s one last look between PATRICK2 and ROBERT2, tears

                           to your flat, pass out there, but I 
                           don’t want the children to see you

                           Home! How sweet of you to think of 
                           it as my home! I’m not in that

                           Christ, this is hell, it’s like 
                           being in hell. You, you of all 
                           people, should know...this is 
                           intolerable! You know? ‘The service 
                           is intolerable, the noise is 
                           intolerable’ Well, this is fucking 
                           intolerable. I am not ELEANOR1 and I 
                           will not stand by and watch the 
                           disgusting, pitiful spectacle of 
                           you destroying yourself, and I 
                           certainly won’t let the boys watch 
                           it either. It’s too much and it’s 
                           gone on for too long.

                And she goes, leaving PATRICK2 on the floor.

                The communal hallway is bleak and depressing, the timed light 
                switch clicking off as he struggles to fit his key in the 
                lock. 
        28      INT. BEDSIT, WEST LONDON 2004 - NIGHT                      28
                The place looks even bleaker now, impossible to bear. A 
                decision.
                From the kitchen, a bottle of whisky. Methodical and 
                strangely calm, PATRICK starts to drink -

                - and wakes up the next morning, PATRICK lying in the debris 
                of bottles and ashtrays, barely alive.
                The phone rings. Answering it is inconceivable - he is still 
                drunk - so he lies and listens.

                               (a pause, a sigh)
                           Hope you’re okay. The boys asked 
                           about you. We’ll talk, but do know - 
                           we do love you.
                She hangs up. He pulls the phone towards him, dials a number.  
                                     PATRICK
                           Hello, directory enquiries please. 
        30      EXT/INT. MINICAB, WEST LONDON 2004 - DAY                   30
                A profoundly sick PATRICK collapses into the back of a 
                minicab, clothes stuffed in plastic bags. 
        31      INT/EXT. MINICAB, ROAD 2004 - DAY                          31
                The cab heads west out of the city -

                - then on into countryside. PATRICK, exhausted and pale, 
                sleeps with his head against the window. His hands are 
                shaking, sweat is pouring from him - more than a hangover.
        32      INT/EXT. MINICAB/COUNTRY HOUSE 2004 - DAY                  32
                The taxi pulls up. PATRICK stuffs notes into the DRIVER’s 
                hand and gets out. 
                A large, rather grand COUNTRY HOUSE. PATRICK regards it 
                warily, then picks up his bag and stumbles towards it.
                                     HENRY (O.S.)

                THE PRESENT, and HENRY, PATRICK’s avuncular, wealthy cousin 
                from Mother’s Milk has arrived. He shakes PATRICK’s hand 
                warmly -
                                     HENRY
                           - I was staying at the Connaught 
                           and when they wheeled in The Times 
                           with my breakfast, I saw that your 
                           mother had died!
                                     PATRICK
                           I’m sorry, the last time we spoke 
                           was at Nancy’s. I’m afraid I was a 
                           bit of a nightmare. 
                                     HENRY
                           Well, I guess no-one enjoys being 
                           unhappy. It tends to spill over. 
                                     PATRICK
                           It does, but I’m glad you made it.
                                     HENRY
                           I loved your mother very much. She 
                           had an innocent quality that drew 
                           you in and kept you distant at the 
                           same time. 
                                     PATRICK
                           At least part of that is very true.
                                     HENRY
                           Well whatever you feel about her, 
                           you know she was a good woman with 
                           the best intentions. 
                He places a hand on PATRICK’s shoulder.

                He goes. PATRICK stands for a moment, pondering that word 
                ‘innocent’. He’s watched by MARY. He sees her, smiles - 
                A Bach chorale calls people to their seats. We stay on MARY. 
        34      EXT. GARDEN, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 1997 - DAY               34
                FLASHBACK. MARY2 is PREGNANT with THOMAS. PATRICK2 is playing 
                happily with ROBERT2 (precise date here depends on YOUNG 
                ROBERT2’s age, but some time around 1997). A happier time in 
                the marriage, with PATRICK2 still sober. 
                Pre-Transpersonal Foundation days. ELEANOR2 is relatively 
                healthy - no stroke yet - and coherent, attempting, somewhat 
                awkwardly, to confide.
                                     ELEANOR2
                           I think my problem is that I can 
                           never forget he’s DAVID1’s son.
                                     MARY2
                           Does he remind you of DAVID1m?
                                     ELEANOR2
                           Flashes, when PATRICK2’s angry or 
                           sarcastic. Which thankfully is less 
                           often now.
                               (a moment, a breath)
                           Does PATRICK2 talk to you about DAVID1?
                                     MARY2
                           I don’t think he haunts him the way 
                           he once did.

                           ‘Haunts’
                PATRICK2 charges across the lawn, ROBERT2 laughing on his back.
                                     ELEANOR2 (CONT’D)
                           But you are alright?
                                     MARY2
                           Hm?
                                     ELEANOR2
                           He treats you well? And the 
                           children?
                                     MARY2
                           Of course. He’s not his father.

                           Can I show you something? In 
                           private. 
        35      INT. DINING ROOM, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 1997 - DAY          35
                The room is gloomy after the afternoon sunlight. ELEANOR 
                wrings her hands in anxiety as MARY2 reads a letter, shocked, 
                disquieted.
                                     ELEANOR2
                           It came last week. I get an awful 
                           lot of letters, usually people 
                           asking for a helping hand, and I 
                           give it if I can, but this is 
                           something different. 
                                     MARY2
                           She seems deeply damaged.
                                     ELEANOR2
                           Clearly she’s a very unhappy woman, 
                           the alcohol, the depression, but 
                           really - to lay this at my door - 
                                     MARY2
                           Do you remember her?
                                     ELEANOR2
                           Of course! The family were 
                           charming. She was a bright, happy 
                           little girl. DAVID1 could be harsh, 
                           but the children were always safe, 
                           DAVID1 was better with children, 
                           playful even, so long as they 
                           weren’t too noisy.
                MARY2’s anger is tangible - 
                                     ELEANOR2 (CONT’D)
                           All I know is that family seemed 
                           perfectly happy. They told me 
                           they’d had a lovely time.
                                     MARY2
                           She says your DAVID1 interfered 
                           with her.
                                     ELEANOR2
                           But how could he?! It was 
                           inconceivable, literally, I could 
                           not conceive of such things - 
                                     MARY2
                           No suspicion - 
      Patrick Melrose - 'At Last'- Ep 5                                   22
                                     ELEANOR2
                           No -
                                     MARY2
                           No signs -
                                     ELEANOR2
                           None at all. That’s what makes me 
                           so angry ’I forgive you’. She 
                           forgives me for not protecting her, 
                           but how could? From what? I didn’t 
                           even know this kind of... behaviour 
                           existed?
                MARY2 can’t bear this. She stands. Outside, PATRICK2 and ROBERT2 
                are playing. MARY2 watches from the window as they walk 
                towards the house.
                                     ELEANOR2 (CONT’D)
                           You mustn’t say a word about this.

                                     ELEANOR2
                           It will only unsettle him, all this 
                           talk of blame and forgiveness. 
                           Goodness, I know what a tyrant his 
                           father could be, but I did my best. 
                           Always my very, very best to 
                           protect PATRICK2.
                                     MARY2
                           Except leave.
                                     ELEANOR2
                           I did.
                                     MARY2
                           Yes, you did. Eventually.
                                     ELEANOR2
                           PATRICK2 was always safe. Always. 
                           I’m sure of it.

                MARY2, shaken by the conversation, walks numbly down the 
                corridor. Piano continues off-screen. She turns into her 
                bedroom.

                           Are you awake?
                                     MARY2
                           The things you told me, when we 
                           met. About DAVID1 - 
                                     PATRICK2
                           What’s brought this on?
                                     MARY2
                           We have to talk about it again. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           I’ve really nothing more to add -
                                     MARY2
                           I think you should tell your 
                           ELEANOR1.
                               (PATRICK2 groans)
                           I’m sorry, I know you don’t want 
                           to, I know it’s hard -
                                     PATRICK2
                           Why then?
                                     MARY2 
                           Because...she can’t keep hiding.

                In the PRESENT DAY, MARY sits at the front, eyes blurred; the 
                photo of Eleanor on the order of service. She’s joined by 
                PATRICK, full of manic, nervous energy. 
                                     PATRICK
                           It’s show-time -
                               (the red eyes)
                           Are you alright?
                                     MARY
                           Yes, yes, just thinking about your 
                           mother.

                           A highly suitable choice, madam. 
                A moment and then they start to giggle. The ceremony begins, 
                BACH replaced by ‘I Got Plenty of Nuthin’’, this time the 
                version by Paul Robeson, scratchy and more sombre.

    Patrick Melrose - 'At Last'- Ep 5       24
                      NANCY
                When I think of how we were brought 
                up, to end up in a crematorium in 
                Mortlake. All the lovely things, 
                all the lovely houses, where have 
                they all gone?
                      NICHOLAS
                Presumably they’re where they’ve 
                always been, but they’re being 
                lived in by people who can afford 
                them.
                      NANCY
                But that’s just it, I should be 
                able to afford them. And to be 
                cremated too; fire is something one 
                dreads.
                      NICHOLAS
                If you ask me, the Egyptians got it 
                right with the Pyramids. 
                      NANCY
                Yes! Something huge and permanent 
                with all one’s things, lots and 
                lots of things, tucked inside. 
          ANNETTE2 from the Foundation steps up to the lectern. 
                      NICHOLAS2
                Oh, Christ. It’s the Spiritual Tool 
                Box -
                      ANNETTE2
                  (As the MUSIC stops)
                What a great choice for ELEANOR1! A 
                fitting reminder, too, of her 
                incredibly strong connection with 
                the African-American people.
          PATRICK2 and MARY2 are giggling now, MARY2 squeezing his arm. 
                      ANNETTE2 (CONT’D)
                All of you will have known ELEANOR1 
                in different ways and if my ELEANOR1 
                is not yours, all I will say 
                is...let her in. Let her in.
                  (more giggles)
                I first met ELEANOR1 when a group of us 
                from the Dublin Women’s Healing 
                Drum Circle went down to her 
                wonderful house in Provence which 
                many of you know well -
                  (she looks to PATRICK2. He

                           When we arrived we saw her sitting 
                           on the wall of the terrace, hands 
                           tucked under her thighs, for all 
                           the world like a lonely young 
                           child, dreaming about the future... 
        39      INT. BUNYON’S FUNERAL PARLOUR, LONDON 2005 - NIGHT         39
                FLASHBACK to five days before. PATRICK2 is alone with his 
                ELEANOR2’s remains in the subterranean chapel.
                                     ANNETTE2 (V.O.)
                           Soon she’d flung her arms wide to 
                           greet us, but I never lost that 
                           first impression of her child-like 
                           quality - 
                The room is plain, more functional than the New York chapel 
                of rest. With trepidation, he steps closer like a man 
                approaching a cliff edge.
                                     ANNETTE2 (V.O.)
                           - her belief that justice could be 
                           achieved and that there was 
                           goodness in every person and every 
                           situation, no matter how hidden it 
                           might seem at first sight. 
                She is holding the satin rose that we saw in the opening 
                sequence. He leans over and touches her chest, startled at 
                its thinness. He kisses her forehead, noting its coldness. 
                There’s none of the rage and malice that he felt in 
                confronting his father’s corpse in ‘Bad News’. It’s sad, more 
                tender.

                           Not sure. A little longer, please?
                Something gnawing -

                FLASHBACK. PATRICK is wheeled on a trolley, drips of saline 
                attached. The stately home is a REHAB CLINIC, and PATRICK is 
                an emergency admission, dressed in plain hospital clothing, 
                hastily-packed bag on his lap. White-faced, shaking 
                uncontrollably. Even in his junkie days, he wasn’t as unwell 
                as this.

                                     DOCTOR PAGAZZI
                           You’re undergoing delirium tremens. 
                           Do you know what that is, Mr. 
                           Melrose?
                                     PATRICK2
                           It rings a bell.
                                     DOCTOR PAGAZZI
                           Then you’ll know what to expect. 
                           Shaking, sweating, there may be 
                           some hallucinations. We’ll get you 
                           something to stabilise your heart, 
                           stop you having seizures - 
                                     PATRICK2
                           I’m going to die -
                                     DOCTOR PAGAZZI
                           You’re not going to die - 
                                     PATRICK2
                           I don’t mind.
                               (head back, under his 
                                breath)
                           I want to die, I want to die, I 
                           want to die...
        41      INT. SUICIDE PREVENTION WARD, REHAB CLINIC 2004 - NIGHT    41
                PATRICK2 writhes on the bed, tangled in the sheets soaked with 
                sweat. Shaking uncontrollably, teeth chattering, he is 
                finding it hard to breathe, suffocating. 
                He leans over the side of the bed. A vivid hallucination, 
                water churning, threatening to drown him.

                EVENING
                Day three of the detox. Bruised, gaunt and shaking, PATRICK2 
                walks the corridors.  
        43      INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE, REHAB CLINIC 2004 - DAY              43
                Still gaunt and shaking, he sits opposite DOCTOR PAGAZZI.
                                     DOCTOR PAGAZZI
                           How often would you say you have 
                           suicidal thoughts?
                                     PATRICK2
                           When I was younger it’s all I 
                           thought about. I never questioned 
                           it.

                           of a whisper. On a quiet coastal 
                           path, in a chemist, driving on the 
                           motorway -

                           And now? 
                                     PATRICK2
                           I look at the window and wonder 
                           whether this floor is high enough. 
                DOCTOR PAGAZZI takes this in.

                           when I became a man, I put away 
                           childish things.

                THE PRESENT, and MARY2 is reading at the lectern.
                             MARY2                         NICHOLAS2
                For now we see through a           (whispered, to NANCY2)              *
                glass, darkly; but then face     Christ, not this old                 *

                           ...and now abideth faith, hope, 
                           love, these three; but the greatest 
                           of these is love. 
                MARY2 returns. There’s a hiatus as the mourners consult their 
                orders of service. 
                But he’s shaking, resistant. Panic setting in. MARY2 squeezes 
                his hand; Can you do this?
                And PATRICK2 stands a little unsteadily and approaches the 
                lectern -  
        45      EXT. GARDEN, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE, 1997 - DUSK             45
                PATRICK approaches his mother, who sits at her favourite 
                place. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           Lovely spot.

                                     ELEANOR2
                           It is. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           Do you...mind if I join you?
                ELEANOR2 looks to PATRICK2; not usual behaviour at all. ELEANOR2 
                stiffens slightly. 
                                     ELEANOR2
                           Please.
                The sun is setting. They sit for a moment, but the tension in 
                the air is palpable and eventually - 
                                     PATRICK2
                           I’ve been trying out different 
                           combinations of words and none of 
                           them are right, so perhaps if I 
                           don’t think too much and just come 
                           out with it.
                               (a deep breath - no 
                                turning back)
                           When we were here, when I was a 
                           child and we used to come here, and 
                           for some years afterwards, DAVID1 
                           used to, he used to rape me - 
                                     ELEANOR2
                               (immediately)
                           Me too. 
                               (a beat)
                           Me too.
                A moment. On PATRICK2, his confusion, his disbelief -  
                                     PATRICK2
                           Me too?
                They return to the view in silence - the subject closed.

                - continue as he stands at the lectern, searching for words. 
                Time passes. The congregation shifts uneasily. He looks to 
                the audience - finds JOHNNY, finds MARY, concerned- the only 
                two who know. He drops his head. On the lectern in front of 
                him, the cue cards, blank except for -  
                ‘?’
                Eventually -

                           I’ve not prepared a speech. As 
                           you’ll see.

                                     PATRICK2 (CONT'D)
                           A lot has been said about my 
                           ELEANOR1’s innocence, how child-like 
                           she - all I know is that when I was 
                           a child - when DAVID1 - why 
                           didn’t she...couldn’t she -
                               (he’s starting to falter 
                                now, to break down, to 
                                remember -)
                           ‘Me too’! Me too.
                He shakes his head, looks to the audience - finds JOHNNY2, 
                finds MARY2, concerned.
                                     PATRICK2 (CONT’D)
                           I’m sorry, I can’t...I can’t do 
                           this...
                And hurriedly, head down, he walks past the congregation... 
                - and keeps walking, out of the door.
                There’s a brief pause, some awkward shuffling. MUSIC UP, Fly 
                Me to the Moon by Frank Sinatra. Some smiles, some laughter 
                at the choice, relief. The coffin starts to move towards the 
                red curtain.
                MARY2 is on her feet, heading out to -

                CONTINUOUS 
                The crematorium has an outside terrace, and here PATRICK2 
                stands, tearful, ashamed, trying to light a cigarette with 
                shaking hands. He hears the door behind, and glances around.
                                     PATRICK2
                           I swear, if one more person tells 
                           me how innocent ELEANOR1 was -
                                     MARY2
                           She might not have been, but even 
                           so -
                            PATRICK2                     MARY2 (CONT'D)
                Don’t, MARY2, please do not       - it’s an emotional time, 
                try and make things better -     you’re bound to feel -               *
                                     PATRICK2
                           STOP! This isn’t mourning or grief, 
                           it’s rage, I feel my heart racing 
                           with it. She knew, she must have, 
                           surely she must have, even 
                           unconsciously, deep down, she knew 
                           what he was like and yet she failed 
                           to do the single thing she was 
                           obliged to do, to protect her 
                           child!

                           Christ knows I’ve been a fucking 
                           useless father -  husband too and 
                           I’m sorry - but if I thought 
                           someone was going to harm our 
                           children, I’d fight. Even I would 
                           do whatever it took because if you 
                           love someone, you protect them. But 
                           ELEANOR1? Christ, no wonder my 
                           father stuck with her! All those 
                           kids around and a son thrown into 
                           the bargain, he couldn’t believe 
                           his fucking luck!

                           Years and years and years of it, 
                           doing whatever DAVID1 wanted, whenever 
                           he wanted. Nobody should do that to 
                           anybody else -

                           Christ, MARY2, I’m a fucking mess. 
                           I thought I was getting better, I 
                           really did, but - 
                He holds out his shaking hands, examines them.
                She reaches across. Takes his hand. 
                They sit in silence.

                A procession of limos drives down a street on crematorium 
                grounds. PATRICK2, still shaken, sits in MARY2’s car and looks 
                out the window as the tombstones pass by outside.

                their recovery, chat happily, loll listlessly, cry, sleep.

                           share stories -
                A little way apart from everyone, PATRICK is reading The 
                Tibetan Book of the Dead. Or rather he is pretending to read 
                it. Instead he steals glances at a 20 year-old patient who 
                sits, bored and petulant, across the room. This is BECKY.

                           horrors. Of course, I’ve played my 
                           part, I lay in bed for ten months 
                           not uttering a single syllable and 
                           when I did start I couldn’t stop 
                           because of all the things that had 
                           piled up -

                           human excrement, smeared all over

                           can take the brandy out of the

                           I think a lot of my relationship 
                           problem stems from the fact that 
                           the person I’m having a 
                           relationship with doesn’t know

                           Fuck, Jill! No wonder you’re here 
                           for the ninth time!
                JILL runs from the room. GORDON, the moderator, turns on 
                BECKY.

                           You’re going to have to apologise 
                           for that.
                                     BECKY
                           Why? I meant it!
                                     GORDON
                           That’s why you have to apologise. 
                                     BECKY
                           But I wouldn’t mean it if I 
                           apologised.

                           make it.
                And now BECKY storms out, tossing chairs as she goes. 
                To PATRICK she is perfect!

                Later, PATRICK2 is walking along the corridor when he sees 
                BECKY hurrying towards him tearfully. 
                                     BECKY
                           I was looking for you -
                               (pulls him to one side)
                           They’re throwing me out. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           Really?
                                     BECKY
                           They say I’m a disruptive 
                           influence. I ‘don’t contribute’. Of 
                           course I don’t fucking contribute, 
                           I’m depressed! Fuck, I hate this 
                           fucking place!
                GORDON has spotted them. 
                                     GORDON
                           Rebecca - 
                A slip of paper, palmed into PATRICK’s hand.
                                     BECKY
                           I can’t go back to my parents. This 
                           is my sister’s address. She’s away 
                           so I’ll be there alone. 
                She kisses him quickly on the lips.

                           Come and find me. 
                And she heads off, glancing back. The slip of paper, held 
                tightly in his hand.

                From the cell-like room to the luxurious black leather of the 
                limo, as it joins the others outside the tall, fine Georgian 
                building on a quiet West London street. They sit in the car, 
                PATRICK still badly shaken.
                                     MARY2
                           Are you going to be alright?
                                     PATRICK2
                           Let’s find out.
                He gets out -
                - and THOMAS runs up and leaps into his arms. He kisses his 
                son, and puts his arm around ROBERT2 who, rather self-
                consciously, embraces his father. 
                                     PATRICK2 (CONT’D)
                           Hello, you two. How’s your other 
                           granny?

                           PATRICK2! After the disinheritance, 
                           it would have been hypocritical of 
                           me to go to the funeral. But the 
                           party’s a different matter. I want 
                           to support you. Of course it helps 
                           that it’s just around the corner.
                PATRICK2 turns and - 
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           PATRICK2, what an unusual speech. So 
                           eloquent. And how thrilling to be 
                           introduced, at my advanced age, to 
                           a new club. ‘The Onslow Club’! I’ve 
                           never heard it mentioned...
                Keen to avoid NICHOLAS2’s corrosive atmosphere, PATRICK2 steps

        62      INT. HALLWAY, RECEPTION, ONSLOW CLUB 2005 - CONTINUOUS     62

                                     NICHOLAS2
                           Is this your eldest?
                                     PATRICK2
                           Yes - ROBERT2.
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           What a pity DAVID1 isn’t here to 
                           enjoy your sons. DAVID1 would at least 
                           have ensured that they didn’t spend 
                           the whole day in front of the 
                           television. I remember vividly, 
                           when we had seen some children 
                           practically giving birth to a 
                           cathode ray tube, DAVID1 said to me “I 
                           dread to think what all that 
                           radiation is doing to their little 
                           genitals”
                NICHOLAS2’s hand is on ROBERT2’s head.

                           ROBERT2, go find your mother -
                               (ROBERT2 leaves)
                           How’s your daughter, NICHOLAS2?

                           Well, I presume. We’ve not spoken 
                           for years. 
                Point scored, PATRICK2 goes to leave, but NICHOLAS2 recovers.
                                     NICHOLAS2 (CONT’D)
                           I can’t help thinking how much your 
                           DAVID1 would have savoured this 
                           occasion. Whatever his drawbacks as 
                           a parent, he never lost his sense 
                           of humour.
                                     PATRICK2
                           Easy not to lose what you never 
                           had.
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           I disagree. DAVID1 saw the funny side 
                           of everything. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           DAVID1 only saw the funny side of 
                           things that didn’t have one.
                NICHOLAS2 begins, with some difficulty, to remove his heavy 
                overcoat.
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           Well, cruelty and laughter have 
                           always been close neighbours...

                DAVID1     had a rare and       - NICHOLAS2, I understand how 
                precious disdain for the         much you must miss my other 
                opinions of most people. He      amazing parent -                     *

                           mourn ELEANOR1. 
                And with that, PATRICK2, shaking with rage, hurries upstairs 
                leaving NICHOLAS2 struggling with the straitjacket overcoat.

                                     PATRICK2
                           No, I’ve got to get some air. I’m 
                           going to walk around the block.

                           gets me away from my awful 
                           children, the little shits, I 
                           loathe them. Do you have children 
                           yourself?

                           If I have one word of advice, it’s 
                           this. Amitriptyline. The only time 
                           I’ve been happy was on it, but the 
                           bastards won’t give me any -

                           The thing is, I’m trying not to 
                           take anything.

                           Don’t be ridiculous. It’s the most 
                           marvellous drug.

                about his decision. The drug’s are wearing off, the DTs are 
                returning, and the DRIVER’s banter is failing to cheer him 
                up.

                “...and now I keep thinking I’m a 
                moth!” “Very interesting”, says the 
                psychiatrist, “Und vot made you 
                come here today?” He says “Well, I 
                saw the light in the window...”

                Do you specialise in these jobs

                You say that, but last year for 
                four months I literally couldn’t 
                get out of bed. Couldn’t see the 
                point. 
                      PATRICK2

                      DRIVER
                Believe me, Mr PATRICK2 Melrose, in a 
                month’s time you’ll look back at 
                this and think ‘What was all that 
                fuss about?’ ‘What was I thinking!’
          PATRICK2 is scrutinising BECKY’s scrap of paper. If you feel 
          like doing something crazy...
                      DRIVER (CONT’D)
                That’s what happened to me, anyway.
                  (they look to the flat)
                This it then? Very nice. They’ll be 
                pleased to get their dad back.
                      PATRICK2
                Who?
                      DRIVER
                The kids.
                  (offering his hand)
                Good luck with it, mate.
          BECKY at the window, just a glimpse; she doesn’t see PATRICK2.
                      PATRICK2
                Actually, I know this sounds crazy, 
                for want of a better word, but 
                could you take me back?

                           I don’t think I’m quite ready. 
                Exasperated, the DRIVER starts the car. Under his breath -

                           Fuckin’ hell, you people. 
                And PATRICK takes one last look at BECKY’s flat and the 
                promise of oblivion.

                In the present day, PATRICK slows, stops, stands catching his 
                breath. He looks back in the direction that he has come from, 
                back to the wake -

                               (long pause)
                           Courage opened the door...
                               (long pause)
                           And there was nobody there!
                PATRICK2 enters. The group turn to stare.
                                     PATRICK2
                               (taking a seat)
                           Please. Carry on.
                They know what has happened. GORDON gives a little round of 
                applause, joined by JILL, ANNABEL, TERRY, even FLEUR -
                 - until everyone is applauding. Uncharacteristically, 
                PATRICK2 succumbs to the wave of goodwill.

                sees is that large photograph of his mother, welcoming him 
                in. 
                Gradually faces turn to stare -
                Then turn away. MARY smiles. HENRY is chatting amiably to the 
                kids, NICHOLAS ranting at ANNETTE, who smiles benignly.

                           Oh, I still want to leave. I want 
                           to leave with that waitress and

                And he heads towards HELENE but is intercepted by -

                           charity shops she ran. I was 
                           thought by some, by everyone in 
                           fact, to be unemployable, but she 
                           trusted me enough to run the 
                           Kensington branch and that, I’m 
                           afraid, is when I had one of my

                           morning, an amazing sable coat, and 
                           I put it on, in July, emptied the 
                           till, shut up shop, hailed a cab 
                           and said ‘Take me to The Ritz!’ I 
                           sat in the Palm Court drinking 
                           champagne cocktails and talking to 
                           anyone who would listen. Eventually 
                           the police were summoned, and I had 
                           no-one to call on but your mother. 
                           She said she was used to it because 
                           she was always clearing her 
                           father’s bar bills in grand places. 
                           I promised I wouldn’t do it again,

                A moment. Then they leave together, noticed by MARY, joined 
                by JOHNNY.
                                     JOHNNY
                           It’s a shame some things don’t 
                           change.
                                     MARY
                           That? Oh, I don’t mind any more. 
                           It’s better now. We’re a lot closer 
                           since we separated.

                                     JULIA2
                           So what did the lunatic say?
                                     PATRICK2
                           She suggested there were no easy 
                           conclusions about what someone’s 
                           life means. 
                                     JULIA2
                           You can come to a conclusion about 
                           what it means to you.
    Patrick Melrose - 'At Last'- Ep 5       44
                      PATRICK2
                Actually, I feel inconclusive about 
                both my parents.
                      JULIA2
                Sounds exhausting. Isn’t it easier 
                just to loathe their guts?
                      PATRICK2
                Yes, I tried that with DAVID1. 
                No good. The truth is I feel 
                everything; contempt, pity, rage, 
                terror... and tenderness -
                      JULIA2
                Tenderness?
                      PATRICK2
                At the thought of how unhappy he 
                was, they both were. Then I 
                remember I have sons of my own and 
                the loathing...floods back.
          But JULIA2, distracted, checks her eyeliner.
                      JULIA2
                I hate bereavement, it plays havoc  
                with your eyeliner. 
                      PATRICK2
                I didn’t realise ELEANOR1 meant so 
                much.
                      JULIA2
                Oh, nothing to do with ELEANOR1. It’s 
                just the way tears spring on you, 
                at a silly film or a funeral. Not 
                brought on by the thing that 
                triggers them, just from a 
                generalised sadness, I suppose. 
                Life being so maddening. 
                      PATRICK2
                Sometimes the trigger and the 
                sadness are the same. Occasionally.
                  (zealous, a resolution)
                Christ, I wonder what it’d be like 
                to have an unconditioned response 
                to things, to anything, without 
                irony or detachment, just to be 
                spontaneous, to feel something - 
                      JULIA2
                Well, it’s no use asking me - 
                      PATRICK2
                No. But I don’t want to die without 
                finding out.
      Patrick Melrose - 'At Last'- Ep 5                                   45
                Suddenly, as if on cue -
                                     HELENE
                           I’m sorry, but you can’t smoke out 
                           here. 
                                     JULIA2
                           Oh. I didn’t know. It’s funny, 
                           because it is outside - 
                                     HELENE
                           Technically it’s still part of the 
                           club, and there’s no smoking 
                           anywhere in the club. 
                                     JULIA2
                           Well, I’d better put it out then. 
                She continues to smoke for a while, a long while, the three 
                of them standing in awkward silence as any feeling that 
                PATRICK might have felt for JULIA drains away. 
                She drops the cigarette on the floor and stalks off. 
                HELENE the WAITRESS sighs and puts down the tray so that she 
                can pick up the smouldering butt. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           Here, let me - 
                And PATRICK bends down, picks it up, drops it on the tray.
                                     PATRICK2 (CONT’D)
                           Sorry about that.
                                     HELENE
                           S’okay. I’m used to it. 
                But before he can think to respond, HELENE leaves.
                A moment. A decision - 
        66      INT. UPSTAIRS, ONSLOW CLUB 2005 - CONTINUOUS               66
                And we follow PATRICK as he rushes through the guests, up to 
                HELENE.
                                     PATRICK2
                           Hello, excuse me, I just wanted -
                                     HELENE
                           Tea or Coffee?
                                     PATRICK2
                               (searching for pen and 
                                paper)
                           Actually, no, something else -  
    Patrick Melrose - 'At Last'- Ep 5       46
          No paper - he’ll have to use the order of service. MARY2, with 
          THOMAS, notices while talking to HENRY.
                      HENRY
                I’d expected more people. She was 
                very well-loved. 
                      MARY2
                ELEANOR1 lost touch with people when she 
                stopped speaking. Must have been 
                terrible, not to be able to say 
                what she wanted, especially to 
                PATRICK1. That’s if she knew what 
                she wanted to say -
                      HENRY
                Poor ELEANOR1. 
                      MARY2
                It’s why we must all resolve to 
                drop our defences and say what we 
                feel, while we can.
                  (THOMAS comes to her, and 
                   jumps into her arms)
                At this point the English usually 
                say ‘Well this is a cheerful 
                subject!’ 
          KETTLE bustles up, HENRY leaves.
                      KETTLE
                I see you two are still glued to 
                each other.
                      MARY2
                  (Enough!)
                Will you go find ROBERT1? 
                  (THOMAS leaves)
                Well, no-one can hope to ignore 
                their children as completely as you 
                did - 
                      KETTLE
                MARY2! We always communicated!
                      MARY2
                Do you remember what you said to me 
                when you telephoned me at school to 
                say daddy had died?
                      KETTLE
                I said how awful it was - 
                      MARY2
                ‘Cheer up!’ Cheer up, you said. You 
                never had any idea who I was then 
                and you still don’t now...
    Patrick Melrose - 'At Last'- Ep 5       47
          And MARY heads off, leaving KETTLE gasping. But here’s FLEUR -
                      FLEUR
                How are you, dear?
                      KETTLE
                Well considering I’ve just had my 
                head bitten off by my daughter -
                      FLEUR
                Has she had mental health problems? 
                      KETTLE
                I beg your pardon?
          HENRY is with NANCY, watching FLEUR in horror.
                      NANCY
                When I think of Mummy’s funeral - 
                eight hundred people, half the 
                French cabinet, the Windsors, the 
                Aga Khan -
                      HENRY
                Eleanor chose a different path. 
                      NANCY
                More like a goat track.
                  (FLEUR is on the move)
                Here comes the Green Goblin. Wagon 
                formation!
          And as NANCY turns her back, FLEUR is left stranded, but 
          rebounds towards NICHOLAS2.
                      FLEUR
                Have you had mental health 
                problems?
                      NICHOLAS2
                Have we met?
                      FLEUR
                I have a feeling for these things. 
                So, have you?
          NICHOLAS2 inhales deeply, then, in a great stream - 
                      NICHOLAS2
                No I have not had ‘mental health 
                problems’. Even in this degenerate 
                age of confession and complaint, 
                when the vocabulary of Freudian 
                mumbo-jumbo is emptied onto every 
                conversation like vinegar onto a 
                newspaper full of sodden chips, 
                some of us choose not to ‘tuck in’!

                just trying to help this poor    happy to turn my daughter

                I’ll call an ambulance -         He got himself worked up -

                I’ll warn reception -            ‘Hoist with his own petard’ 
                                                 as they say -
                Now ANNETTE2 steps in, cradling his head, lips moving in 
                silent prayer. JULIA2, watching - 
                                     JULIA2
                           Oh God, that would really finish me 
                           off. Is she praying?
                                     ROBERT2
                           That’s nice of her.
                                     JULIA2
                               (to PATRICK2, standing with 
                                the boys)
                           They say you should never speak ill 
                           of the dead so I’d better get a 
                           move on. I’ve always thought 
                           Nicholas Pratt was a perfectly 
                           ghastly man.
                                     ROBERT2
                           That’s a horrible thing to say. 
                           He’s just an old man. 
                                     JULIA2
                           Well, you know it’s time to leave 
                           the party when the children attack 
                           you -
                               (she looks to PATRICK2 but 
                                he has gone)
                           Say goodbye to your father for me.
                And she slips away.

                On NICHOLAS2 now. The pride, the eloquence, has all gone and 
                now there’s an awful fear in his eyes, and rage too at his 
                own vulnerability. His mouth works silently, attempting to 
                express the torrent of words in his head. 
                And now, for the first time, PATRICK2 is there, loosening his 
                tie. He grasps at PATRICK2’s hand, staring at him desperately. 
                PATRICK2 does not reject his grip.
        67      EXT. ONSLOW CLUB, ONSLOW GARDENS 2005 - DAY                67
                NICHOLAS2 PRATT is carried out on a stretcher to the waiting 
                ambulance. PATRICK2 reports to MARY2, ROBERT2 and THOMAS.
                                     PATRICK2
                           Heart attack apparently. They can 
                           tell by the cold nose.
                                     ANNETTE2
                           I’ll go with him to the hospital.
                               (embracing PATRICK2, who 
                                stands stiffly)
                           What an emotional day!
                               (crossing to Nicholas, 
                                taking his hand)
                           Don’t you worry, NICHOLAS2, I’m not 
                           going to leave your side. 
                And there’s one last moment of eye contact between PATRICK2 
                and NICHOLAS2, his father’s representative on earth.

                           Is that woman going with him? He’s 
                           practically my oldest friend! I 
                           know - I’ll take his car and follow 
                           on. 
                                     KETTLE
                               (to NANCY)
                           You couldn’t drop me off on the 
                           way, could you?
                                     NANCY
                               (indignant)
                           It’s Nicholas’s private car, dear, 
                           not a limo service.
                She hurries off. JOHNNY2 now - 
                                     JOHNNY2
                           I must go, I’ve got a patient at 
                           four.
                               (they embrace)
                           Well done -

                                     PATRICK2
                           For what? The public breakdown?
                                     JOHNNY2
                           In the trade it’s what we’d call a 
                           breakthrough. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           Hm. At the risk of getting 
                           Californian - I’m grateful. 
                And then suddenly the family is alone. ROBERT2 takes his 
                PATRICK2’s hand.
                                     ROBERT2
                           Are you coming back with us?
                A glance at MARY2 -
                                     MARY2
                           You’d be very welcome.
                                     PATRICK2
                           No, I’ll see you at the weekend.
                                     MARY2
                           You can come and have dinner with 
                           us if you like. Just us four. Very 
                           quiet.
                                     PATRICK2
                           No, I think I’ll just crash out. 
                           It’s been a long day.
                                     MARY2
                           Well, if you change your mind - 
                                     ROBERT2
                           In fact you should change your 
                           mind. That’s what it’s for. 
                PATRICK2 laughs at this. A kiss from MARY2, and they leave. 
                He stands alone for a moment on the street in the spring air.
                FADE TO BLACK. The ringing of a phone, loud, persistent, just 
                as in the opening of Bad News.
        68      INT. HALLWAY, BEDSIT, WEST LONDON 2005 - DAY               68
                PATRICK is rushing to catch the phone before it stops, 
                fumbling for his keys - 
        69      INT. BEDSIT, WEST LONDON 2005 - CONTINUOUS                 69
                He runs through the door, breathless, and grabs at it.
    Patrick Melrose - 'At Last'- Ep 5       52
                      PATRICK2
                Hello?
                      VOICE
                PATRICK2? Hello, PATRICK2 is that 
                you?
                      PATRICK2
                Yes -
                      ANNETTE2 (O.S.)
                ANNETTE2 here. I’m afraid I have 
                rather bad news. NICHOLAS1 didn’t 
                make it. He stopped breathing in 
                the ambulance. Oh, PATRICK2, are you 
                crying?
                      PATRICK2
                No, just...out of breath. Though of 
                course I’m also very sad.
                      ANNETTE2 (O.S.)
                An amazing man, completely unique.
                      PATRICK2
                Let’s hope so. The idea of a 
                village full of NICHOLAS1 Pratts is 
                rather terrifying.
                  (a change of tone)
                I’m sorry, it just occurred to me 
                that he was the last one. Last of 
                my parents’ circle. They’ve all 
                gone now. 
                      ANNETTE2 (O.S.)
                Oh, now you’re making me cry!
                      PATRICK2
                Really. There’s no need. Thank you 
                for what you said at the funeral 
                too. It was helpful to have another 
                point of view.
                      ANNETTE2 (O.S.)
                She might not have been a perfect 
                ELEANOR1. That must anger you, I 
                expect. But those who deserve the 
                most blame also deserve the most 
                help, and she was fundamentally a 
                good person.
                      PATRICK2
                You seem very sure of that.
                      ANNETTE2 (O.S.)
                I’m sure that she tried, which is 
                as much as any of us can do. 
                Goodbye, PATRICK2. God bless you.

                She hangs up, and after a while PATRICK2 hangs up too. 
                He lies for a moment, looking at the ceiling. The sound of a 
                piano. DAVID2’s theme - 
                                     DAVID2 (O.S.)
                           PATRICK2? PATRICK2, where are you? 
                           PATRICK2!
        70      INT. HOTEL BATHROOM, PROVENCE 1970 - DAY                   70
                The cheap hotel DAVID2 took him too. We’ve seen this 
                before, in Bad News and Some Hope, but now we’re on the other 
                side of the bathroom door with YOUNG PATRICK2, pacing, 
                tearful, fists clenching and unclenching, muttering to 
                himself. 
                YOUNG PATRICK2 looks in the mirror, screwing up all his 
                courage, then walks into the other room -
        71      INT. HOTEL ROOM, PROVENCE 1970 - DAY                       71
                DAVID2 waits.
                                     DAVID2
                           Come and sit here.
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                           No.
                                     DAVID2
                           Beg pardon?
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                           No. I won’t do what you say 
                           anymore! 
                                     DAVID2
                           PATRICK2...
                               (standing, shaken)
                           PATRICK2. Don’t talk like that to 
                           your dear old DAVID2. 
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                               (in a great rush)
                           It’s wrong. DAVID2’re wrong! Nobody 
                           should do that to anybody else and 
                           I won’t have it, I won’t! Not any 
                           more. NO. NO. NO. NO. NO!
                In the face of his PATRICK2 resistance, DAVID2 falters. For the 
                first time, he is vulnerable, weak. 
                DAVID2 feels behind PATRICK2 for the bed and sits, and crumples. In 
                front of PATRICK2’s eyes, DAVID2 MELROSE falls apart.

                There are tears in PATRICK2’s eyes, and for a moment he feels 
                desperately alone in this bedsit, this non-bachelor’s 
                bachelor pad.
                Then he sits suddenly, wipes at his eyes - ‘snap out of it’ - 
                and searches in his pocket.
                Here is the Order of Service, with ELEANOR1’s photo. And here

                           ‘Helene’
                He reaches for the phone, looks at the number. He dials.
