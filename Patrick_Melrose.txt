                A TELEPHONE RINGS. A loud, persistent electronic trill - 
                                                                  FADE IN:
        1       INT. HALLWAY, ENNISMORE GARDENS, LONDON 1982 - DAY          1
                The telephone rings in the hallway of a rather messy flat, 
                curtains drawn against the May sunlight.
                A figure appears at the end of the hallway. A thin face, 
                handsome, fine-featured, eyes of a startling intelligence, 
                but a certain vampiric sallowness to the skin.
                This is PATRICK2 MELROSE, twenties, unsteady, distracted. He 
                regards the phone like an enemy, picks up. Then -
                                     PATRICK2
                           Hello. Hello?
                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                               (well-spoken, distant)
                           PATRICK2? Hello, PATRICK2 is that 
                           you?
                                     PATRICK2
                           NICHOLAS2? 
                                     NICHOLAS2 (O.S.)
                           PATRICK2, I’m afraid I have rather 
                           bad news.
                PATRICK2 doesn’t move, his face entirely impassive.
                                     NICHOLAS2 (CONT’D)
                           Hello? Hello, PATRICK2? Can you hear 
                           me? I’m in New York. There appears 
                           to be a delay. Can you hear me? It 
                           concerns DAVID1.
                                     PATRICK2
                           I’m here. 
                                     NICHOLAS2(O.S.)
                           DAVID1 died the night before 
                           last, in his hotel room. It must 
                           come as an awful shock to you. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           Something like that.
                PATRICK2 sits dazed, and an object falls to the floor. PATRICK2 kneels to 
                retrieve it.
                                     NICHOLAS2 (O.S.)
                           I hardly need to tell you how I 
                           feel. I adored DAVID1. 
                                     (MORE)
      
                                     NICHOLAS2 (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                           Everybody liked DAVID1. I know DAVID1 
                           wasn’t always the easiest of men. 
                           Are you there, PATRICK2?
                PATRICK2 picks up the object, puts it on a side table. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           Yes, yes. Where is he now?
                The object is a SYRINGE.
                                     NICHOLAS2 (O.S.)
                           DAVID1? He’s at Frank E. Macdonalds, 
                           the funeral people on Madison. 
                           Everyone goes there. ‘Only the best 
                           or go without’ as DAVID1 would 
                           have said. If you want to see DAVID1 
                           and collect the ashes - do you have 
                           much on?
                                     PATRICK2
                           Not at this exact moment. 
                PATRICK2 rolls down his sleeve and watches as the blood soaks 
                through the shirt.
                                     NICHOLAS2 (O.S.)
                           Then we must meet up. Why don’t we 
                           meet at the Key Club? George 
                           Watford’s here, we’ll raise a glass 
                           to your DAVID1’s extraordinary 
                           life. Until then, I’m sorry to be 
                           the bearer of such sad tidings.
                                     PATRICK2
                           Yes, it’s a great blow. Goodbye. 
                And PATRICK2 hangs up. A moment - 
                - and then a grin, a great, ecstatic smile, breaks out on 
                PATRICK2’s face as he laughs and laughs.

        2       EXT. VINEYARDS, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE, PROVENCE 1967 - MORNING2
                A brief glimpse of YOUNG PATRICK2 MELROSE at EIGHT YEARS-OLD, 
                running, running full-pelt down through vineyards, slashing 
                at the vines with a wooden stick. 
                From the distance, his father’s voice -
                                     DAVID (O.C.)
                           PATRICK! PATRICK, where are you?
      
                YOUNG PATRICK comes to a halt, breathless, and turns towards 
                the fine old house overlooking a valley of vineyards and 
                woodland. 
                A doorbell rings, and we crash -
        3       EXT/INT. DEBBIE’S FLAT, KENSINGTON 1982 - DUSK              3
                 - back into the present. DEBBIE HICKMAN, twenties, earnest, 
                opens the door - 
                                     PATRICK2
                           DAVID1’s only gone and died.
                And immediately she embraces him. PATRIC2K stands awkwardly, 
                arms out to the side. 
        4       INT. BEDROOM, DEBBIE’S FLAT, KENSINGTON 1982 - DUSK         4
                They lie on the bed, DEBBIE doing her best to comfort him, 
                PATRICK2 tense and rigid. 
                                     DEBBIE
                           How did DAVID1 die?
                                     PATRICK2
                           I forgot to ask, I was so dizzy 
                           with glee. I’m sorry, I mean dazed 
                           with grief. I wonder - could you 
                           please stop playing with my hair?
                               (PATRICK2 sits up irritable, 
                                heroin wearing off)
                           I need a drink, a proper drink. 
                           Let’s celebrate -
                PATRICK2 gets up and roams the flat; the decor neat, conventional; 
                magazines, family photos, not PATRICK2’s thing at all. 
                                     DEBBIE
                           We could go out and have a glass of 
                           wine. You’re probably not 
                           interested, but we’re invited to 
                           Gregory and Rebecca’s for dinner.
                                     PATRICK2
                           ‘Suffering takes place while 
                           someone else is eating.’ Who said 
                           that?
                               (a beat.)
                           I’m sorry. I feel rather mad at the 
                           moment.
                                     DEBBIE
                           It was a complicated relationship. 
                           There’s a lot to think about.

                                     PATRICK2
                           Yes, and I’m not sure if all the 
                           heroin is helping either.
                                     DEBBIE
                               (choosing her words)
                           Do you think that was a good idea?
                                     PATRICK2
                               (snapping)
                           Of course it wasn’t a good idea!
                                     DEBBIE
                           I merely meant that perhaps this 
                           would be a good time to make a 
                           change. Start afresh!
                                     PATRICK2
                           Yes, well I have to go, before you 
                           tell me to seize the fucking day.

                                     DEBBIE
                           Do you think, now that he’s dead, 
                           that you could be a little less 
                           like him?
                                     PATRICK2
                           Unlikely. I’ll simply have to do 
                           the work of two. 
                But this notion - that PATRICK1’s becoming DAVID1 - is enough 
                to stop him in his tracks. 
                                     PATRICK2 (CONT’D)
                           Debbie, I’m sorry, I’m not fit for 
                           human company.
                                     DEBBIE
                           Don’t go like this. Stay. Come back 
                           to bed.
                                     PATRICK2
                           I can’t. 
                But for a moment, he relents. She kisses him. 
                                     DEBBIE
                           I’d heard somewhere, I don’t know 
                           if it’s true, that grief was meant 
                           to be an aphrodisiac. D’you think 
                           that might be true?
                And she kisses him again.

        6       INT. BEDROOM, LONDON 1982 - NIGHT                           6
                PATRICK2 lies in bed, smoking. 
                                     PATRICK
                           Why should that be? It seems to 
                           imply that sex is some sort of 
                           antidote to death, or that it’s 
                           somehow life in its purest form. 
                           Which with me, of course, it 
                           absolutely is. 
                A cushion flies through the air. Not DEBBIE, but JULIA2, mid 
                ‘20s; smart, sardonic, a match for PATRICK2’s cynicism. Music 
                on stereo; Joy Division or The Au Pair’s Headache for 
                Michelle.
                                     JULIA2
                           You wish. I’m so pleased you came 
                           to see me. How’s ELEANOR1 taking 
                           it?
                                     PATRICK2
                           ELEANOR’s with Save The Children in 
                           Chad, no-one can break the news.

                           Always thinking of others.
                                     PATRICK2
                           Indeed.
                               (glass of whisky, a pill)
                           What’s this?
                                     JULIA2
                           Valium. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           That’s more like it. By the way. I 
                           think I’m going to give up drugs. 
                PATRICK2 is simultaneously smoking a cigarette, taking a pill and 
                drinking whisky. JULIA2 laughs. 
                                     PATRICK2 (CONT’D)
                           You don’t think I can.
                                     JULIA2
                           I’m a little sceptical.
                                     PATRICK2
                           I’ve done it before.
                                     JULIA2
                           Exactly! What’s so different this 
                           time? You’re hardly the Rehab-type 
                           and besides, you like it too much.

                           Well, you’re wrong. I’m going to 
                           get it right this time.

                           Heroin and cocaine anyway. No point 
                           running before I can walk.

                           Please don’t take this the wrong 
                           way, but does this mean you’re now 
                           fantastically rich?

                           No, ELEANOR’s the one with the 
                           money, and she’s very healthy.
                                     JULIA2

                A glass of whisky on the white tiles. Three SYRINGES, two 
                crested SPOONS burnt on their underside, a lighter, anti-
                sceptic wipes, a tie that he uses as a tourniquet. Five wraps 
                of HEROIN.

                Cigarette in mouth, whisky in hand, PATRICK2 takes the syringe 
                and bends the needle against the tiles. Then the next. Then 
                the next. Bravado, absolute self-confidence.
                PATRICK2 bends the last of the syringes and tosses the 
                equipment into the bin. 
                He opens a wrap of heroin and is about to pour it into the 
                toilet - 
                - hesitates - 
                - searches in the wastepaper bin -

                PATRICK stands beneath the scalding jet, the cigarette still 
                dangling from his mouth, woozy from absolutely his last-ever

                YOUNG PATRICK again. The house is cool after the morning sun, 
                and YOUNG PATRICK2 walks very quietly towards the music. 
                He stands in the doorway. A figure at the piano, in dressing 
                gown and pyjamas. DAVID2 stops playing suddenly, reaches for his 
                cigar.
                                     DAVID

                On PATRICK’s arm, yellow bruises, pink threads of old scars 
                disappear beneath a crisp white shirt. A stylish black jacket 
                is shrugged on, a black tie. Stylish mourning.
                A large sum of money is tucked into one pocket, a passport 
                into the other. Battered suitcase at his side, he sits, full 
                of dread at what awaits him.

                           Congratulations.
                He’s with JOHNNY, his best friend, and fellow addict, 
                bookish, milder. He affects the same cynicism as PATRICK, but 
                it’s an act, a flippancy that masks real affection.
                                     PATRICK
                           Yes, nearly the full set.

                A beat, and they both laugh.

                           anywhere. I’m serious, JOHNNY2. You 
                           must do whatever you want, but if 
                           I’m taking control of my life, then 
                           now’s the time. This is the most

                Final call, a fond goodbye.

                           so many things, I couldn’t have 
                           made it without you.

                shivering with fever.
                                     PATRICK (V.O.)
                           Queasy, nervous, maggots under the 
                           skin, litter of drowning kittens in 
                           my stomach. Come on, come on....
                               (a spasm of pain makes him 
                                gasp)
                           Ow! Fuck off. Just fuck off!
                The DRIVER glares in the rear-view mirror.

                           Can you go any faster? I really, 
                           really need to get to my hotel.

                And now he’s stumbling out into the street, hunched and 
                wincing from the sunlight like a vampire. He doles out MONEY 
                from the stack in his coat pocket, large notes, almost as if 
                trying to be rid of the stuff.
        21      INT. DRAKE HOTEL, MANHATTAN 1982 - DAY                     21
                The DRAKE HOTEL is plush, but stuffy. THE RECEPTIONIST 
                smooth, unflappable, discreet. Throughout the hotel scenes, 
                he is a constant, omniscient presence and consequently a 
                source of some paranoia for PATRICK. Whatever happens, he 
                knows.
                                     THE RECEPTIONIST
                           Mr Melrose! Good to see you again. 
                           Your usual suite is ready. And a 
                           message for you -
                A message slip, in C.U. To: PATRICK Melrose. From: ELEANOR1.
                            Message: No Message.
                                     PATRICK2
                           Always eloquent -
                               (screwing up the note)
                           And could you send up a bottle of 
                           whiskey and a very great deal of 
                           ice, immediately please. 
                                     THE RECEPTIONIST
                               (rings a bell)
                           Of course. 
                A tiny, elderly BELL-BOY bobs nearby, eager for more tips.

        23      INT. HOTEL SUITE, DRAKE HOTEL, MANHATTAN 1982 - CONTINUOUS23
                Crammed with chinoiserie, the suite manages to be luxurious 
                and dowdy at the same time.
                           BELL-BOY                     PATRICK (V.O.)
                Bathroom, shower. This is the    Here we go. You know the 
                bathroom light. Here’s your      drill. Another withdrawal in 
                TV. Turn it on here, and this    a foreign hotel room. 
                is how you change channels -     Paranoia, cramps, suicidal 
                                                 thoughts...
                                     PATRICK
                           Yes, I’ve used a television before- 
                A WAITER brings the whiskey and ice. PATRICK doles out more 
                tips recklessly, and finally he’s alone. PATRICK pours the 
                whisky over a glass-full of ice. Gulping - 
                                     PATRICK (CONT’D)
                           Still, at least it’s the last time.
                               (he drains the glass)
                           Or among the last times.
                               (he laughs, pours another 
                                drink)
                           No, not this time. The bastards 
                           won’t get me this time. No 
                           prisoners. Concentration like a 
                           flame thrower. 
                He opens the curtains wide, takes in the sight of Central 
                Park unrolling uptown, leafy and hot, beautiful on this early 
                summer day. 
                                     PATRICK (CONT’D)
                           The trick is not to think about it.  
                           But how can you not think about it? 
                           It’s like not wanting to get out of 
                           a wheelchair when the room’s on 
                           fire.
                He looks down. Thirty-three floors, straight down.
                                     PATRICK (CONT’D)
                           That ought to do it.

                His fingers examine the edges of the window, searching for an 
                opening. A twist of dread, of vertigo. He presses his head 
                against the glass - an uninvited memory.
        24      EXT. WOODS, LACOSTE 1967, FLASHBACK - DAY                  24
                A deep, DEEP WELL, a circle of sunlight just visible at the 
                bottom. 
                YOUNG PATRICK drops a stone into it, counts - 
                                     YOUNG PATRICK
                           1..2..3..4..
                A distant splash. Deep enough. He steps back and clambers up, 
                so that he is standing on the edge of the well -

                           it.
                He steps back from the window as if rejecting an idea and -

                           PATRICK? Yes, nanny? What you need, 
                           young man, is a nice walk in the

                The Frank E MacDonald funeral parlour is a solemn Upper-East 
                Side establishment. The piped Bach Chorale plays, and among 
                the lilies and Doric columns, an elegant FEMALE RECEPTIONIST 
                waits like an air hostess for a flight to the Afterlife. All

                           That’s better. Sorry. One moment - 
                               (gathers himself)
                           Now. I’ve come to see the corpse of 
                           DAVID1 Melrose.
      PATRICK Melrose - 'Bad News'- Ep 1                                  16
        30      INT. HALLWAY, FRANK E MACDONALD’S, MANHATTAN 1982 - DAY    30
                PATRICK steps out of the elevator into a long hallway.
                                     FEMALE RECEPTIONIST
                           You’ll find Mr. DAVID1 at the end 
                           of the corridor.
                The doors close. She’s gone, and PATRICK2 is alone. PATRICK2 stands 
                a moment, frozen, vulnerable and fearful.
                The music has changed. No longer Bach, it’s now PATRICK2’S 
                THEME, played on the piano. Breathing hard, PATRICK2 starts to 
                walk.
                From his P.O.V., a voice, fierce and furious, comes from 
                behind the door.
                                     DAVID2 (V.O.)
                           PATRICK2! Come here! RIGHT NOW!
                And the camera swings around to find - 
                YOUNG PATRICK, terrified, walking along the SAME CORRIDOR.
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                               (in a whisper)
                           Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Saturn 
                           - no, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, 
                           Jupiter...
                He pushes open the door - 
        31      INT. DAVID’S BEDROOM, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 1967 - DAY      31
                DAVID MELROSE sits on the edge of his bed in the bare, gloomy 
                room.
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                           But what have I done wrong?
                Our first clear sight. Handsome, fierce and terrifying.
                                     DAVID2
                           Go and close the door. 
                                     YOUNG PATRICK
                           I don’t understand. 
                He is shaking, terrified.
                                     DAVID
                           Do I have to close it myself?
                DAVID sighs, stands, walks past him.
      PATRICK Melrose - 'Bad News'- Ep 1                                  17
                                     DAVID (CONT’D)
                           Very well...
                YOUNG PATRICK, quaking, sweating, sees a blur of vivid green 
                on the wall.
                A LIZARD. He watches as it clambers up the wall, focussing 
                all of his concentration on the creature.
                DAVID2, meanwhile, closes the door with ‘us’, the camera, on 
                the outside. 
                We PULL OUT SLOWLY, retreating from the closed door
        32      INT. HALLWAY, FRANK E MACDONALD’S, MANHATTAN 1982 - DAY    32
                And now ADULT PATRICK2 stands there. A deep breath, as if 
                about to plunge through ice. His hand is shaking - withdrawal 
                or something else - as he reaches for the handle and - 
                CRACK. SPARKS fly from door knob to his hand. Static 
                electricity. He wipe his hand on his trousers, reaches again 
                and opens the CLOSED DOOR to find - 
        33      INT. MOURNING SUITE, FRANK E MACDONALD’S, MANHATTAN 1982 - 33
                DAY
                A PARTY! A COCKTAIL PARTY in full flow. Twenty or so well-
                heeled, mostly elderly Manhattanites in big hats and bright 
                clothes, lightweight tartan and sunglasses, stand between a 
                bemused PATRICK and his father’s corpse. 
                                     WAITER
                           Martini, sir?
                                     PATRICK2
                           What? No, thank you...
                                     WAITER
                           Mojito? Mint Julep? Old-fashioned? 
                But he pushes his way towards the coffin, and sees - 
                - a SMALL, WHITE-HAIRED MAN, very much not his father. On a 
                table beside the body a sign reads ‘In Loving Memory of 
                Hermann Newton’
                                     ELDERLY MOURNER
                           And how did you know Hermann?
                                     PATRICK2
                           I can’t fucking believe it!
                                     ELDERLY MOURNER
                           Oh, ho! Whoa there...
      PATRICK Melrose - 'Bad News'- Ep 1                                  18
                And he strides out - 
        34      INT. RECEPTION, FRANK E MACDONALD’S, MANHATTAN 1982 - DAY 34
                - and STORMS into reception.
                                     PATRICK2
                           WRONG FUCKING CORPSE! 
                                     FEMALE RECEPTIONIST
                           Oh. Are you sure?
                                     PATRICK2
                           Death transforms us all, but it’s 
                           not so powerful as to turn my 
                           DAVID1 into a small Jew. Try. 
                           Again.
                                     FEMALE RECEPTIONIST
                               (scrambling through 
                                paperwork)
                           But we don’t have another party in 
                           the building. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           I don’t want to go to a party, I 
                           want to see DAVID1 MELROSE!
                                     FEMALE RECEPTIONIST
                           There isn’t any name on here except 
                           Mr. Newton’s.
                                     PATRICK
                           Well maybe my father isn’t dead 
                           after all! Maybe it was just a cry 
                           for help, what do you think?
                                     FEMALE RECEPTIONIST
                           One moment, please - 
        35      INT. HALLWAY, FRANK E MACDONALD’S, MANHATTAN 1982 - DAY    35
                And now he follows a dapper, precise FUNERAL DIRECTOR down 
                another corridor, to another doorway.
                                     FUNERAL DIRECTOR
                           This is the correct room.
                                     PATRICK2
                           Thank you. And please apologise to -
                                     FUNERAL DIRECTOR
                               (He removes the empty 
                                cocktail glass)
                           It’s an emotional time. 
      PATRICK Melrose - 'Bad News'- Ep 1                                  19
                                     PATRICK2
                           Yes, that’s why I took a Quaalude 
                           but it must have been a dud. 
                                     FUNERAL DIRECTOR
                           I’m...sorry to hear that.
                                     PATRICK2
                           Can I pick him up later? I’d like 
                           to get away from New York if at all 
                           possible.
                                     FUNERAL DIRECTOR
                           DAVID’s ashes will be 
                           available tomorrow afternoon.
                                     PATRICK2
                           I see. No chance of a rush job?
                                     FUNERAL DIRECTOR
                           I’ll leave you alone with DAVID1.
                At this, PATRICK’s bravado evaporates. Real dread now.
                                     PATRICK
                           Come on. Let’s get this right.
                A moment to gather himself. PATRICK gingerly tests the handle 
                - no shock - takes hold - rests his head on the door. 
                                     PATRICK (CONT’D)
                           Come on, come on, come on...
                PATRICK enters. 
        36      INT. MOURNING SUITE, FRANK E MACDONALD’S, MANHATTAN 1982 - 36
                DAY
                The wood-panelled room is bare except for the coffin, 
                slightly tilted, the head towards PATRICK.
                                     PATRICK
                           This is it. Everything left unsaid. 
                           Everything that can never be said. 
                           Say it now.
                He hovers, then approaches. DAVID MELROSE2 has been covered in 
                tissue paper, like a present half-unwrapped.
                                     PATRICK2 (CONT’D)
                               (a thank-you to an 
                                imaginary friend)
                           Is it...is it DAVID2? It is! It’s just 
                           what I wanted! You shouldn’t have!
                He pulls the tissue paper from DAVID’s face.
      PATRICK Melrose - 'Bad News'- Ep 1                                  20
                                     PATRICK (CONT’D)
                           Fucking hell, DAVID2. What are you 
                           doing in a coffin?
                PATRICK2 touches the face; the fierce, noble profile, the bruised 
                eyes. The lower lip protrudes as in life, but there’s a tear 
                in it, a line of dried blood. 
                                     PATRICK2 (CONT’D)
                           What happened here?
                               (PATRICK2 touches the lip.)
                           DAVID2 didn’t want to go, did you? DAVID2
                           knew you were going to die and you 
                           were right. What did that feel 
                           like, pain or rage? Were DAVID2
                           scared? Christ, I hope so.
                A tiny noise. PATRICK2 looks up. The window is curtained. A 
                distinctive, heavy ornate curtain pole.
                The GREEN LIZARD, the hallucination, is quite distinct and he 
                watches as it scampers up the wall, pauses, looks to PATRICK2.
                PATRICK2 closes his eyes, forcing down a memory. 
                                     PATRICK2 (V.O.)
                           Do not have that thought, do not go 
                           to that place....
                PATRICK2 punches the coffin once. Twice, suppressing a memory.
                                     PATRICK2
                           Bastard. Bastard, bastard, bastard -
                And then, as if aware of being watched, he straightens up and 
                smiles contemptuously. Bravado again - 
                                     PATRICK2 (CONT’D)
                           Aw, DAVID2. You were so fucking sad, 
                           man, and now you’re trying to make 
                           me sad too.
                               (he walks suddenly away)
                           Well, bad luck.  
                He strides across the room and closes the door. 
        37      INT. BAR, DRAKE HOTEL, MANHATTAN 1982 - DAY                37
                A pill, a martini, a cigarette - the Trinity. PATRICK2 sits in 
                a plush booth in the hotel restaurant. PATRICK2 raises the brimming 
                martini glass to his lips. 
                                     PATRICK2
                               (the Quaalude)
                           Just work this time, will you?
      PATRICK Melrose - 'Bad News'- Ep 1                                  21
                But his hand is shaking. He puts it down again, closes his 
                eyes -
                                     ANNE2 (O.S.)
                           PATRICK2?
        38      INT. HALLWAY, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 1967 - NIGHT            38
                FLASHBACK to YOUNG PATRICK sitting on the stairs. A woman, 
                ANNE, stands over him, kindly, concerned, and takes his hand, 
                shaking with fear, rather than with withdrawal. 
                                     ANNE2
                           You’re shaking. What is it? D’you 
                           want to tell me? PATRICK2?
                               (squeezing his hand)
                           Stay here? I’ll be right back, I 
                           promise.
        39      INT. BAR, DRAKE HOTEL, MANHATTAN 1982 - DAY                39
                Quickly, PATRICK swallows the pill with the martini.
                                     ANNE2 (O.S.)
                           That looks fun.
                PATRICK2 opens his eyes, and here’s ANNE2 now, taking his hand again

                           I’m sorry too. Punctuality is one 
                           of the smaller vices I’ve inherited 
                           from DAVID1 -

                           I think you know that’s not what I 
                           meant -
                               (to a passing waiter)
                           Tea please, Earl Grey.

                               (the martini)
                           For me it’s nine o’clock.

                           For you, it’s always nine o’clock. 
                           What the hell - a martini for me 
                           too, please.

                                     ANNE2 (CONT'D)
                               (she slides in)
                           So, have you been to - ?
                                     PATRICK
                           The mortuary? Yes, the best I’ve 
                           ever seen DAVID1.
                                     ANNE2
                           I don’t want to disillusion you, 
                           but when they give you the ashes, 
                           they’re really just the communal 
                           rakings from the bottom of the 
                           oven.  
                                     PATRICK2
                           That’s good news! Ideally they’d 
                           all belong to someone else. 
                               (he lights her cigarette - 
                                an old friend and ally)
                           When I was young, DAVID1 used to take 
                           us to restaurants - I say 
                           ‘restaurants’ in the plural, 
                           because we never stormed in or out 
                           of less than three. I remember once 
                           DAVID1 held a bottle of claret upside 
                           down while the contents gurgled out 
                           onto the carpet. ’How dare you 
                           bring me this filth?’
                                     ANNE2
                           At least he’s somewhere DAVID1 can’t 
                           complain about.
                                     PATRICK2
                           I half expected DAVID1 to sit up like 
                           a vampire at sunset. ‘Call this a 
                           coffin? The service here is 
                           intolerable!’
                               (ANNE2 laughs)
                           Mind you, the service was 
                           intolerable. They sent me to the 
                           wrong corpse.
                                     ANNE2
                           The wrong corpse?
                                     PATRICK2
                           Yes, ironic that DAVID1 remains were 
                           so hard to find. I have no trouble 
                           discovering them in myself.
                               (ANNE2 smiles, and he takes 
                                her hand)
                           It’s good to see you ANNE2. I did 
                           need a friendly face.
                ANNE2 takes this in, but the admission comes just as PATRICK2 
                is becoming slurred and clumsy. The Quaalude kicking in -

                           That’s why I was so keen to talk to 
                           you today. I’ve always felt -
                               (PATRICK2 is sliding down

                           PATRICK2, are you okay?
                                     PATRICK

                                     PATRICK2
                           Let’s not exaggerate. Just a little 
                           sleepy. The antibiotics. Will you 
                           excuse me?

                With some difficulty, he finds the speed capsule in his 
                coat’s capacious pockets, cracks it open, taps some out onto 
                the cistern.

                He snorts. Winching, pinching his nose - he waits...
                And now the slurring is replaced by a manic self-confidence 
                and energy as the speed cuts through the thick night of the 
                Quaalude.

                manic self-confidences, his face, shirt, and suit dripping

                And now the SOMMELIER pours a little wine, yellow and 
                unctuous, presents the bottle for approval.
                                     PATRICK

                           But it’s not heroin. Shhhhh!
                And the food arrives. QUICK CUTS now of PATRICK gorging 
                violently on the salmon and wine with an addict’s fervour, 
                dousing the steak tartar with Tabasco, finishing the white 
                wine and now the red, while the VOICE in his head speaks with

                           everything be okay? It’s too much

                           Here’s the deal. If he answers,

                He dials. The phone rings. PATRICK’s hand is shaking in 
                anticipation. It rings...and rings. A spasm of pain.

                           It got on fire. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           I knew there was something. CHILLY WILLY2 
                           said you might have a new syringe.
                                     MRS WILLY
                           Well it ain’t exactly new, but I’ve 
                           boiled it and everything. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           Is it very blunt?
                               (she produces it from down 
                                the side of the chair. 
                                The world’s biggest 
                                syringe.)
                           No, that’s a bicycle pump.
                               (she puts it away)
                           Oh, alright. How much?
                                     MRS WILLY
                           Two bags?
                                     PATRICK2
                               (tossing her the wraps)
                           Do you have a bathroom I can 
                           borrow?

                The bathroom is even more horrific than the bedroom, 
                blackened and filthy in the yellow light. PATRICK2 stands, arm 
                braced, searching for a reluctant vein.

                           are! There -

                1982 - NIGHT
                PATRICK2 storms back in, broken syringe in hand.
                                     PATRICK2
                           May I suggest, CHILLY WILLY2, that you 
                           invest in a new light-bulb? Hardly 
                           worth the effort, I missed the 
                           vein. Look!
                An awful black blister on his arm.
                                     CHILLY WILLY2
                           Shoulda used the flashlight.
                He clicks the torch on, shines it in PATRICK2’s face.
                                     PATRICK2
                           Well thanks for telling me! I need 
                           new works. CHILLY WILLY2? CHILLY WILLY2!
                But they’re lost to the real world. PATRICK2 storms out -

                - and stride up the street, eyes casting left and right.

                               (in NANNY’S VOICE)
                           Now young man, you’ve had your fun, 
                           go back to the hotel, take a nice 
                           pill, go to sleep and in the 
                           morning you’ll be right as -
                               (- doubling over,

                           Fuck! Oh Christ, that hurts!
                He reaches for support, bracing himself, looks up and finds - 
                A pay-phone. It must be fate. He finds a quarter. Sweating, 
                shaking, he dials urgently -

                           Five-five-five-one-seven-two-six...

                           Who is this?
      PATRICK Melrose - 'Bad News'- Ep 1                                  33
                                     PATRICK
                           PATRICK from London. I’m...having 
                           trouble sleeping.
                                     PIERRE
                           What hotel?
                                     PATRICK
                           The Drake.
                A pause. Unbearable suspense. 
                                     PIERRE
                           My place. Twenty minutes. 
                And he hangs up. PATRICK punches the air with triumph and, 
                revived, breaks into a run.
        56      INT. PIERRE’S APARTMENT, GREENWICH VILLAGE 1982 - NIGHT    56
                RESTORED SCENE. PIERRE steps out of the elevator, skinny, 
                pale, his skin stretched tight. Piercing eyes in a sallow 
                face. 
                                     PIERRE
                           Ca va?
                                     PATRICK
                           It’s a nightmare out there.
        57      INT. PIERRE’S APARTMENT, GREENWICH VILLAGE 1982 - NIGHT    57
                RESTORED SCENE. The flat is large, bare, austere - old Soho. 
                A good stereo plays Talking Heads, something twitchy and 
                sinister, Houses in Motion or The Overload or Born Under 
                Punches. 
                The paraphernalia is all ready, one syringe for PIERRE, two 
                for PATRICK - cocaine and heroin. A ritual, like taking tea. 
                PATRICK counts out the money, PIERRE the drugs.
                                     PIERRE
                           So what was DAVID1 like?
                                     PATRICK2
                           DAVID1? DAVID2 was a kitten, a 
                           prince among men, such artistic 
                           hands, could have been Prime 
                           Minister. 
                                     PIERRE
                           DAVID1 was a politician?
      PATRICK Melrose - 'Bad News'- Ep 1                                  34
                                     PATRICK2
                           No, no, it was sort of a joke. In 
                           DAVID1 world, it was better if a 
                           person could have been Prime 
                           Minister, or a surgeon, or a 
                           concert pianist. Actually achieving 
                           something would have shown vulgar 
                           ambition.
                                     PIERRE
                           Tu regrettes qu’il soit mort? 
                                     PATRICK2
                           I regret that he lived. 
                                     PIERRE
                           Mais sans DAVID1, you wouldn’t exist.
                                     PATRICK2
                           One mustn’t be egotistical about 
                           these things.
                               (He picks up the syringe, 
                                contemplating it.)
                           I had been trying to give this up. 
                The needle breaks the skin, the first time we’ve actually 
                seen this. A bloom of blood in the barrel. Then - 
                From PATRICK’s P.O.V. - CRACKS are starting to appear, on the 
                walls, the floor, on PIERRE’s skin and face, on the mirrored 
                table. The sound of blood in his ears from the rush, like the 
                roar of a jet engine. Sweat breaks out all over his body. He 
                places the syringe down, gasping, hands trembling.
                                     PATRICK (CONT’D)
                           Good God. 
                                     PIERRE

                                     PATRICK
                           Oh, good God...
                He falls backwards -

                - and lies, winded and amazed, on the floor of his hotel 
                room. His heartbeat is incredibly loud, like the blades of a 
                helicopter whirring over his head. His limbs are rigid, the 
                tendons and veins thin and brittle. 
                PATRICK has placed a low coffee table in front of the large 
                TV, laying out his haul of drugs, two syringes, bottled water 
                from the mini-bar. The movie ‘ZULU’ is playing, an old 
                favourite. Rows and rows of Zulu warriors, banging their 
                shields, stamping their feet.
                On the TV, wild cuts - cartoons, horror movies, chat shows, a 
                knife chopping vegetables, a weatherman, a commercial for 
                Crazy Eddie, the channels changing faster and faster. 
                PATRICK on cocaine, pacing wildly. Lots of FAST CUTS here, 
                HALLUCINOGENIC, a long, terrible, exhausting night as he 
                switches between voices, between elation and terror, like the

                A monstrous dawn. PATRICK lies on the floor, the needle still 
                in his arm. White noise on the TV. Warped and distorted, the 
                phone rings on.
                But he can’t move, his limbs still heavy with the concrete. 
                The ringing is louder now but the phone seems a huge distance 
                away and it is only with immense effort that he reaches it.
                Scratchy, barely audible - hallucinatory? - he hears his 
                mother’s voice.

                           PATRICK2, I heard the news. I don’t 
                           know what to say - 
                A crescendo of radio interference, and she’s gone -

                DEBBIE, maintaining an artificial brightness, is getting 
                ready to go out. INTER-CUT
                                     DEBBIE
                           It’s me! You sound sleepy. Are you 
                           sleeping? Did I wake you up? I’m so 
                           sorry, sorry, sorry...

                           It’s five-thirty in the morning.
                                     DEBBIE
                           I thought with the jet-lag you’d be 
                           pacing the room. 
                               (PATRICK2 pulls the syringe 
                                from his arm, sits)
                           Are you at the hotel?
                                     PATRICK2
                           Well, given that you’ve telephoned 
                           me here - 
                                     DEBBIE
                           I merely meant - I’ve been worrying 
                           about you all night and I simply 
                           wanted to know how you are. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           You mean have I taken any drugs?
                                     DEBBIE
                           Not just that. Why, have you?
                He takes in the room, his own condition - a terrible shame 
                and depression; so much for new beginnings. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           Well, I’ve been shooting coke and 
                           heroin all night, does that count?
                On DEBBIE - her disappointment and hurt.

                                     DEBBIE
                           Was that a good idea?
                                     PATRICK2
                           In the future, can we just agree 
                           that, no, it is not a good idea?
                                     DEBBIE
                           I thought...I really thought you’d 
                           be able to make a change.
                                     PATRICK2
                           Me too. But it seems that’s not an 
                           option.
                On the mirrored surface, he notices his right eye. Puffy, 
                inflamed. Oh, God - what now?
                                     DEBBIE
                               (deep breath - optimism!)
                           PATRICK2, you mustn’t be alone -  
                But he HAS to be alone, looking like this. He takes the 
                cordless phone and staggers into the bathroom.
                                     DEBBIE (CONT’D)
                           I’ve arranged for you to have 
                           dinner with someone.
                                     PATRICK2
                           I do not want to see anyone! This 
                           isn’t one of your dinner parties, 
                           Debbie, it’s a very emotional time. 
                           I’m not in a fit state to see 
                           anyone.
                And he really isn’t - pale as a corpse except for the red, 
                BLOODSHOT RIGHT EYE. Shit, shit, shit...
                                     DEBBIE
                           You need to be with people who care 
                           about you, and I’ve already fixed 
                           it with MARIANNE1 -
                                     PATRICK2
                               (he stops dead)
                           MARIANNE1?
                                     DEBBIE
                           My old University friend. You 
                           passed out in MARIANNE1 loo, remember? 
                           They took the doors off -
                It’s all too plain that PATRICK2 does remember MARIANNE1. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           That MARIANNE1 -

                           She’d love to see you. Any time 
                           after seven-thirty. I’ve faxed you 
                           the address...
                And sure enough, there’s the FAX, sliding under the door.  
                PATRICK2 picks it up, scans it - an address, a phone number.
                                     PATRICK2
                           I’ll see whether I feel up to it.
                PATRICK2 hangs up, as DEBBIE continues to talk -

                                     DEBBIE
                           Remember, I do love you.

        64      INT. BATHROOM, HOTEL SUITE, MANHATTAN 1982 - DAY           64
                MUSIC UP - pop music, sharp and bright and inane. PATRICK, 
                livelier now, lugs the TV, still playing, into the bathroom.
                                     PATRICK2
                           MARIANNE1 marianne1 marianne1 -
                The hot tap runs full blast. He sets the TV precariously on 
                the edge of the bath. On the screen - MARIANNE’s face, 
                smiling, sympathetic -
                                     MARIANNE1
                           - it’s so good to see you, PATRICK -
                                     PATRICK2
                           -  and it’s so wonderful to talk to 
                           someone who understands -
                MTV vintage 1982, maybe Physical by Olivia Newton-John, on 
                the screen. Now the huge black pill of speed is in his hand. 
                With a celebratory flourish, he tosses it into his mouth like 
                a peanut then swigs from a glass of bourbon. He winces. 
                                     PATRICK2 (CONT’D)
                           No ice! This is INTOLERABLE! 
                And he heads out to - 
        65      INT. HOTEL SUITE, MANHATTAN 1982 - CONTINUOUS              65
                The main room, where a trolley is piled high with a 
                devastated breakfast - a single bite from the bacon, a single 
                spoonful of porridge - and now it decays and stinks horribly.

                           Everything is wrong, everything is 
                           hopelessly fucked up - 
                He searches through the remains of the breakfast, fishing 
                around in the warm orange juice, but there’s no ice there.
                Punching a table lamp, he goes into the corridor -
        66      INT. HALLWAY, HOTEL, MANHATTAN 1982 - CONTINUOUS           66
                TWO CLEANERS are peering into a hotel suite some way down the 
                corridor. 
                - then stare at barely-dressed, manic PATRICK2, striding 
                towards them, one eyelid drooping, the eye the colour of an 
                egg yolk. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           Ice! Must have more of your 
                           delicious ice, per favor! Room 
                           3318.
                One CLEANING LADY departs, and PATRICK2 peers into the room - 
                a glimpse, a fleeting image, a MAN LYING ON THE BED. White 
                shirt, suit and tie, the face out of sight.
        67      INT. BATHROOM, HOTEL SUITE, MANHATTAN 1982 - CONTINUOUS    67
                Meanwhile steaming hot water lips over the top of the bath 
                and onto the bathroom floor. The TV blares, its power cable 
                taut - 
        68      INT. HOTEL SUITE, MANHATTAN 1982 - CONTINUOUS              68
                PATRICK2 returns with a bucket of ice in time to see water 
                lapping at the edge of the carpet.
        69      INT. BATHROOM, HOTEL SUITE, MANHATTAN 1982 - CONTINUOUS    69
                He splashes in, hopping neatly over the TV flex and turning 
                off the taps. Still clutching the ice he plunges his arm into 
                the water and feels around for the plug. The water is 
                SCALDING HOT. 
                He sits on the toilet seat and looks with amazement and 
                horror at his bare arms. 
                The purple wounds, the track marks, one arm scalded red, the 
                other ivory white. All bravado gone now, he slides to the 
                floor.
                                     PATRICK
                           These aren’t my arms.

                On the TV, WILE E. COYOTE sits astride a rocket, speeding, 
                speeding, over taking ROADRUNNER before smashing into a 
                mountainside.
                                     PATRICK
                           Fine. I nearly died again last 
                           night.
                PATRICK, meanwhile, is in the bath, glass in one hand, phone 
                in the other.

                Curtains drawn against the sun, JOHNNY lies crashed out on 
                the sofa. For once, irony defeats them both. INTERCUT -
                                     JOHNNY
                           I see. Well, maybe this wasn’t the 
                           right time after all. 
        72      INT. BATHROOM, HOTEL SUITE, MANHATTAN 1982 - DAY           72
                On TV, WILE E. COYOTE looks into the camera, face black with 
                soot, then falls, falls, falls.
                                     PATRICK
                           Yes, thank God my father’s dead, 
                           otherwise I’d have no excuse.
                                     JOHNNY
                           I’ve never known you to need an 
                           excuse. When do we two Olympians 
                           meet again?
                                     PATRICK
                               (with his toe, he tests 
                                the balance of the TV at 
                                the end of the bath)
                           At the airport. Bring a lot of 
                           gear. Maybe we’ll finally kill 
                           ourselves tomorrow night.
                A BEAT. PATRICK has never said any of this out loud before, 
                and now that he has, it’s almost...liberating. 
                JOHNNY, meanwhile, wonders if he’s joking. After all, they 
                must never take anything seriously.

                                     JOHNNY
                           Doesn’t seem much of a plan.
                                     PATRICK
                           No. Still, much the kindest thing 
                           to do.
                               (his watch on the bath)
                           I’ve got to go. Drinks with my 
                           father’s friends
                                     JOHNNY
                           Then I’ll leave you to get ready.
                                     PATRICK
                           ‘til tomorrow. Make sure you get a 
                           lot.
                He hangs up and pours the bourbon onto his face, sucking it 
                in until the bottle is empty. 
                Bottle in hand, he lies submerged in the water. 
                Doorbell rings -
        73      INT. HALLWAY/HOTEL SUITE, MANHATTAN 1982 - DAY             73
                The ageing BELL-BOY with a DRUG-STORE PACKAGE.
                The door opens a crack. PATRICK, naked, dripping wet, shoves 
                money into his hand and slams the door.
        74      INT. HOTEL SUITE, MANHATTAN 1982 - DAY                     74
                PATRICK has rediscovered a sort of vengeful glee, Hamlet 
                before The Mousetrap. AN EYE PATCH is settled over the 
                infected eye and PATRICK is ready to inspect himself in the 
                mirror. Clean shirt and tie, cuff-links, beautiful suit. The 
                eye-patch is eccentric, but gives him a pirate’s swagger. A 
                man with a mission -
                On his tie, or shirt perhaps, a dot - he wipes it with his 
                thumb. Blood. He swabs it with his handkerchief.
                Then, like a true gentleman, he takes TWO LOADED SYRINGES and 
                pops them into his breast pocket, disguising them with the 
                handkerchief. 
                                     PATRICK
                           Pip, pip! Be prepared.
                He pulls on his protective overcoat, tosses the drug 
                paraphernalia into his suitcase, locks it, steps back and 
                takes in the room.
      PATRICK Melrose - 'Bad News'- Ep 1                                  43
                It is a scene of total and utter devastation. Broken 
                furniture, sodden carpet, stinking food, bottles and wet 
                towels everywhere. It might have been ransacked by Vikings.
                He sighs, heads for the door, opens it and walks straight 
                into - 
        75      INT. HALLWAY, HOTEL, MANHATTAN 1982 - CONTINUOUS           75
                A POLICE OFFICER. PATRICK’s hand snaps to his pocket - the 
                syringes. With forced casualness -
                                     PATRICK
                           What seems to be the trouble, 
                           officer?
                                     POLICE OFFICER
                           You hear anything suspicious last 
                           night? Noises, cries?
                                     PATRICK
                           No, I was lost to the world.
                He indicates a trolley, being wheeled from the next door room 
                by MEDICS. A covered CORPSE, the CLEANERS looking on. 
                                     POLICE OFFICER
                           Heart attack.
                                     PATRICK
                           Well, the party has to end some day 
                           I suppose. 
                                     POLICE OFFICER
                           There was a party?
                                     PATRICK
                           No, I just meant...
                As the gurney passes, PATRICK glimpses the arm of the CORPSE 
                poking out. The same white shirt, the same gold cuff-links. 
                PATRICK’s own profile beneath the shroud; his future self.  
                                     POLICE OFFICER
                           You’re from England, right?
                               (PATRICK is frozen at the 
                                sight of his own corpse)
                           Hey! You hear me?
                                     PATRICK
                           What? Yes, yes, I’m from England.
                                     POLICE OFFICER
                           I could tell from the accent. 
                                     PATRICK
                           They’ll make you a detective yet!
      PATRICK Melrose - 'Bad News'- Ep 1                                  44
                He strides off, the COP’s eyes burning into his back. 
                                     POLICE OFFICER
                           Take off your coat! You’ll fry out 
                           there!
        76      EXT. THE KEY CLUB, UPPER EAST SIDE 1982 - DAY              76
                Sweating in the noon heat, PATRICK runs up the steps -
        77      INT. THE KEY CLUB, UPPER EAST SIDE 1982 - CONTINUOUS       77
                - into the cool, marbled hallway where he’s met by GEORGE 
                WATFORD, a large red-faced man, unflappable, decent -
                                     GEORGE
                           PATRICK2. Bang on time. Just like 
                           DAVID1. 
                               (they shake hands with 
                                genuine warmth)
                           DAVID1 was very, very proud of you. I’m 
                           sure you know that.
                Here at least, NICHOLAS2 PRATT is sincere in his sorrow.
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           Hello, little man. Sorry for your 
                           loss. You must be feeling ghastly.
                               (on the move)
                           What happened to your eye? Girl 
                           trouble? Now that I’m responsible 
                           for your moral guidance-
                                     PATRICK2
                           Nothing like that. Picked up an 
                           infection on the plane.
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           Well it suits you. Very raffish. 
                           You’ll fit right in here - 
                And they push open the doors to a grand club, Regency London 
                in midtown Manhattan. Up the stairs -
                                     GEORGE 
                           I think you’ll find this place 
                           amusing. DAVID1 did. It had 
                           all the things that you can’t find 
                           in England anymore. Have you had a 
                           Bullshot?
                               (to a WAITER)
                           Three Bullshots please -
                               (then on)
                           I’ve invited Ballantine Morgan, 
                           though I suspect he’s the most 
                           frightful bore.

                           His family own a bank. At least I 
                           think they do. I’ve asked the 
                           question but it’s so hard to listen 
                           to his fucking answers. 
        77A     INT. MAIN ROOM, THE KEY CLUB, UPPER EAST SIDE 1982 -      77A
                CONTINUOUS
                Into the main room - 
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           Here we are - 
                One person. BALLANTINE stands to greet them.
                                     PATRICK2
                           The gang’s all here.
                Gleeful irreverence is infecting him. Fast, back and forth -
                                     NICHOLAS2
                               (moving on)
                           This is Ballantine Morgan -

                               (small, self-satisfied)
                           So sorry about DAVID1. I 
                           didn’t know him personally but from 
                           what George tells me, he was a 
                           great English gentleman! 
                                     PATRICK2
                               (taking their seats)
                           What have you been telling him, 
                           George?
                                     GEORGE
                           Only what an exceptional man your 
                           DAVID1 was.
                                     PATRICK2
                           I certainly never met anybody quite 
                           like him.
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           He refused to compromise! 
                                     GEORGE
                           ‘Nothing but the best, or go 
                           without!’
                                     BALLANTINE
                           I quite agree!

                           ‘Never apologise, never explain’, 
                           that was another one.
                                     GEORGE
                           Yes!
                                     PATRICK2
                           ‘Observe everything’, ‘Trust 
                           nobody’ -
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           All very wise -
                                     PATRICK2
                           ‘Never try, effort is vulgar’, 
                           ‘Things were better in the 
                           eighteenth century’ Oh, and 
                           ‘Despise all women, but your mother 
                           most of all.’
                A deeply uncomfortable pause. Thank God, the WAITER arrives. 
                                     GEORGE
                           And here are our Bullshots! Beef 
                           consommé and vodka; something of an 
                           acquired taste - 
                To their astonishment, PATRICK2 takes the brown, soupy liquid 
                from the tray and drains the whole thing in one go -  
                                     PATRICK2
                           I’ve acquired it! Another please.
                - and any reverence and decorum that PATRICK2 might have had, 
                is evaporating. He’s going to have fun instead. 
                                     GEORGE
                               (moving things on)
                           DAVID1 was very impressive at the piano 
                           - 
                                     PATRICK2
                           If you like pastiche -
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           - and in conversation too -
                                     PATRICK2
                           That depends. Some people don’t 
                           like uninterrupted rudeness, or so 
                           I’m told. 
                                     NICHOLAS2

                                     GEORGE
                           It’s true, I did once tell him to 
                           stop being quite so argumentative.
                                     BALLANTINE
                           And what did he say?
                                     GEORGE
                           Told me to bugger off!
                The men laugh uproariously. PATRICK watches wearily -
                                     PATRICK2
                           What a lot of faithful gun dogs.
                He directs them to the walls, hung with Victorian hunting 
                portraits. NICHOLAS2 is riled, about to intervene - 
                                     BALLANTINE
                           Are you...interested in hunting, 
                           PATRICK2?

                                     BALLANTINE (CONT’D)
                           I thought he might be interested in 
                           a story -
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           The thought you never have is that 
                           someone might not be interested -
                                     BALLANTINE
                           I’d shot a Tanganyikan mountain 
                           goat, the last male of its species, 
                           which of course was rather a 
                           bittersweet moment -
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           For the goat, certainly -

                           Actually I have a hunting story, 
                           Ballantine, from DAVID1. 
                           NICHOLAS2, you know the one - 
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           Steady on, PATRICK2. Enough now.
                                     PATRICK2
                           You’ll like this, Ballantine. My 
                           DAVID1 was a cavalry officer, 
                           stationed in India in the 1920s, 
                           and DAVID1 used to go pig-sticking, 
                           galloping through the high grass 
                           with a lance, chasing wild boar.

                           Very dangerous, these boar, could 
                           easily take down a horse, gore the 
                           rider to death, but thrilling too. 
                           The only blemish on this particular 
                           trip - I heard this story when I 
                           was, what, eight? - was when one of 
                           the party was bitten by a wild dog 
                           and developed the symptoms of 
                           rabies. Three days from the nearest 
                           hospital and this hunting party of 
                           judges and generals decided to 
                           truss up their foaming, thrashing 
                           friend in a net and hoist him off 
                           the ground...
        78      EXT. TERRACE, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 1967 - EVENING          78
                Pre-dinner drinks in 1967, and DAVID2 is holding forth to 
                NICHOLAS2. YOUNG PATRICK2 reads nearby.
                                     DAVID2
                           Dinner was served, lanterns down 
                           the table, silver, well-trained 
                           servants, but none of us could 
                           quite enjoy dinner with all that 
                           screaming. So I got up from the 
                           table, fetched my pistol, went up 
                           to the rabid man and shot him in 
                           the head. 
                               (NICHOLAS2’s smile is 
                                frozen)
                           No cure, you see. Much the kindest 
                           thing to do. Everyone agreed. 
                           Eventually. 
                               (DAVID2 sips his champagne, 
                                relishing the disquiet)
                           And that, I think, was the 
                           beginning of my love affair with 
                           medicine.
                DAVID2 looks to PATRICK2. Smiles -  
        79      INT. TABLE, THE KEY CLUB, UPPER EAST SIDE 1982 - DAY       79
                 - back in New York, PATRICK2 enjoys the disquiet too.
                But the enjoyment is brief. As his fellow diners shift in 
                their seat, PATRICK takes in the sound of music. At some 
                point the pianist has stopped playing Cole Porter and is now 
                playing his father’s composition.
                Panicked, PATRICK2 looks around. The PIANIST is facing away, 
                but from the back could quite easily be DAVID1. PATRICK2 
                stands, knocks over the chair, runs for the door -

                And into the marbled bathroom where he vomits copiously in 
                and around the sink, gasping for breath. The MEMBER next to 
                him is horrified. 
                                     CLUB MEMBER
                           You might have used the cubicle!

                           Good idea - 
                And he stumbles into the peace and quiet of the cubicle and 
                locks the door. 
        81      INT. TOILET CUBICLE, THE KEY CLUB, UPPER EAST SIDE 1982 - DAY81
                He wakes some hours later, nauseous, slimy. He peers at his 
                watch with his one good eye and swears -  
        81A     INT. MAIN ROOM, THE KEY CLUB, UPPER EAST SIDE 1982 - DAY 81A
                - rushing back through the Club, clocking the empty table. 
                Christ, how long has been out? Idiot, idiot, idiot. Then -
        82      EXT. FRANK E MACDONALD’S FUNERAL HOME, MANHATTAN 1982 - DAY82
                - rushing to the funeral home, arriving to find the FEMALE 
                RECEPTIONIST locking the door. He bangs repeatedly on the 
                glass. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           You’ve got DAVID1!

                CONTINUOUS
                The FEMALE RECEPTIONIST recoils - he looks even more deranged 
                than last time as he bangs on the glass.

                I’m afraid we’re closed! I’m     I need his remains! Now! I’m            *
                sorry - if you come back         flying first thing and I                *
                tomorrow...                      can’t leave without DAVID1.                *

                           Also, could I trouble you for a

                           Now, MARIANNE1. I have half a gram 
                           of coke, a fifth of heroin, one 
                           Quaalude, one Black Beauty. A few 
                           lines to get the conversation 
                           flowing, a Quaalude for MARIANNE1 to 
                           get her in the mood. Or perhaps 
                           pity is the way, in which case use 
                           it for the comedown, sleep on the 
                           flight - my God, you’re good - then 
                           you’re home, thank Christ for 
                           Concorde, and JOHNNY1 will be 
                           waiting and - well, let’s see.
                Trotting up to a handsome brownstone, PATRICK2 is jaunty 
                again, a suitor on his way to a date.

                NANCY BANKS, MARIANNE’s formidable mother, opens the door to 
                find PATRICK hugging the BOX to his chest with one hand, 
                rubbing something on his gums with the other. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           Hello, I’m PATRICK2, MARIANNE1’s

                           NANCY, NANCY Banks. We have met. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           Yes, of course. I’m sorry, little 
                           distracted, it’s just  -
                As if to explain, he indicates THE BOX and pulls a sad face.
                                     NANCY
                           Yes, MARIANNE1 told us. Is that him? 
                           I’ll tell Consuela there’ll be one 
                           more for dinner! MARIANNE1! MARIANNE1 She’s 
                           dying to see you!

                           Yes, I turned blue in your

                           We had to take the door off! Come

                The apartment is comfortable, sumptuous.

                           MARIANNE1 says DAVID1 was a remarkable 
                           man.
                                     PATRICK2
                           You should have heard the remarks.
                                     NANCY
                           Was it a difficult relationship, 
                           PATRICK2?
                                     PATRICK2
                           Yes, NANCY, yes it was. 
                                     JERRY
                           When did the trouble start?

                           June the 9th 1906. The day DAVID1 was 
                           born. 
                                     JERRY
                           Well fatherhood was very different 
                           in those days. 
                                     NANCY
                           Yes, perhaps he just didn’t know 
                           how to express his love?
                                     PATRICK2
                           Cruelty is the opposite of love, 
                           not some inarticulate expression of 
                           it. 
                A VOICE - 
                                     MARIANNE2 (O.C.)
                           That sounds about right to me. 
                PATRICK2 turns to see MARIANNE2 BANKS. A husky voice - she 
                doesn’t so much speak as swallow articulately. Beautiful, 
                elegant, poised, kissing her mother and father -

                           I’ve ever had to worry about.
                                     PATRICK2

                           I’m so, so sorry for your loss.
                PATRICK2 puts the BOX down, walks across the room, puts his arms 
                around MARIANNE2, his head on her chest, exhales and holds tight.
                                     PATRICK2 (V.O.)
                           I want to be buried right here. 
                           You’re the answer, you’re the one

                           could have you I’d give up drugs 
                           forever -

                               (looking to her parents, 
                                amused but sympathetic)
                           Goodness!
                                     PATRICK2
                           - or at least have someone 
                           attractive to take them with -
                               (to MARIANNE2, too loud)
                           Are we going out to dinner? Please 
                           say yes!
                                     NANCY
                           Actually, I thought we’d all have 
                           dinner here!
                                     PATRICK2
                               (not looking away)
                           It’s just we have so much to talk 
                           about and I’m not quite ready for -
                               (nods towards parents)
                           Or is that very rude?  
                NANCY bites her lip and scowls, about to object. JERRY 
                indicates - ‘let it go’ - and nods approval to MARIANNE.

        87      INT. ARMENIAN RESTAURANT, UPPER WEST SIDE 1982 - NIGHT     87
                A blue dome, painted with stars; candles, rugs on the walls. 
                The upper-Broadway restaurant is snug, modest, a funky ethnic 
                student hang-out and so not what PATRICK2 is used to at all. 
                But MARIANNE2 is upbeat, sympathetic - her hand on his arm. 
                                     MARIANNE2
                           It’s Armenian, is that alright?
                                     PATRICK2
                           Absolutely. I love Armenian. 
                The BOX sits in its own chair, to PATRICK’s side.
                                     MARIANNE2
                           Aren’t you hot with your coat on?
                                     PATRICK2
                           If it makes you uncomfortable - 
                                     MARIANNE2
                           A little. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           Then off it goes. Perhaps I’ll take 
                           the eye-patch off too...
                               (MARIANNE2 winces a little)
                           I’ll leave it on.
                               (to the WAITER)
                           Two martinis please. 
                                     MARIANNE2
                           One. I don’t drink. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           You don’t? Bad sign, very, very 
                           bad.
                                     MARIANNE2
                           I find it numbs the senses, blurs 
                           the edges -
                                     PATRICK2
                           Your point being? I completely 
                           agree, and I don’t usually either 
                           but, you know - grief!
                               (a silence)
                           Say something, remember how this is 
                           done, something other than lies or 
                           ridicule or contempt - 
                               (So -)
                           Debbie sends her love. Not that, 
                           you fucking idiot.
                                     MARIANNE2
                           Sweet Debbie. How is she?
      PATRICK Melrose - 'Bad News'- Ep 1                                  54
                                     PATRICK2
                           The fuck should I know. She’s a 
                           great girl. Very supportive. Change 
                           the subject. She says you’re 
                           studying law.
                                     MARIANNE2
                           That’s right! At Columbia. It’s so 
                           tough, but I love it.
                                     PATRICK2
                           I once thought about studying law.
                           I used to imagine myself in Twelve 
                           Angry Men, being terrifically 
                           eloquent and righting wrongs - 
                                     MARIANNE2
                           You’d be a wonderful lawyer. You 
                           have to do it! Why don’t you?
                                     PATRICK2
                           Because hard work and ambition are 
                           vulgar.
                                     MARIANNE2
                           PATRICK2, you don’t really think 
                           that -
                                     PATRICK2
                           Me? No, no, no, not at all -
                               (DAVID1’s ashes)
                           That’s what he said. 
                                     MARIANNE2
                           But you have an education, the 
                           financial means. It’s not too late -
                               (reaching across, taking 
                                his hand - contact)
                           - and you’re not DAVID1. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           Of course you’re absolutely right. 
                           I feel quite inspired! I’ll make a 
                           start, soon as I get off the plane. 
                           A new man!
                               (to THE BOX)
                           Did you hear that, DAVID1? I’m going 
                           to be a lawyer! 
                                     MARIANNE2
                               (contact lost again)
                           I’m concerned about the box.
                                     PATRICK2
                           Don’t worry, I think it counts as 
                           hand luggage.

                           I mean, perhaps we could put him on 
                           the floor - 
                                     PATRICK2
                           Yes! Let the waiters kick him 
                           about. Revenge at last! Why should 
                           he get away with it, just because 
                           he’s dead?
                                     MARIANNE2
                           Get away with what?
                A possibility. But his hand is shaking, coming down...
                                     PATRICK2
                           Will you excuse me a moment?
                And he goes, leaving MARIANNE2 alone, sympathy fading -
        88      INT. ARMENIAN RESTAURANT, UPPER WEST SIDE 1982 - NIGHT     88
                Later, Armenian food sits untouched on the plate, unlike the 
                martinis.
                                     PATRICK2 (V.O.)
                           Well this is going well. All the 
                           signs are good -  
                               (MARIANNE2 yawns!)
                           Christ, she wants you. She’s dying 
                           for it, dying for it - 
                                     MARIANNE2
                               (his untouched plate)
                           I thought you liked Armenian food?
                                     PATRICK2
                           The martinis are excellent. 
                He drains the glass, she watches sadly. He’s a mess now.
                                     MARIANNE2
                           ‘They fuck you up, your mum and 
                           dad. They may not mean to, but they 
                           do.’ 
                                     PATRICK2
                           Who says they don’t mean to?
                MARIANNE takes this in - leaning forward again.
                                     MARIANNE2
                           Did you ever tell DAVID1 how 
                           you felt?

                           Not while he was alive. Probably 
                           just as well. 
                                     MARIANNE2
                           Why? What would you have said?
                PATRICK2 is momentarily stilled and silenced by this question. 
                It is...sobering and he is absolutely sincere in his answer.
                                     PATRICK2
                           I’d have said...I’d have told

                           seriously.
                                     MARIANNE2
                           I’m sorry, you were saying -

                The moment of connection has passed now.

                           Good night, PATRICK2.
                The TAXI pulls up. PATRICK2 follows, serious now, no longer 
                playing a part.

                           someone intelligent who wasn’t 
                           afraid to challenge me, I might be 
                           able to get my life back in order.

                You’re making a fool of          Please don’t go, I need some 
                yourself -                       company or I don’t what I’ll

                               (She pushes him away)
                           Self-indulgent little shit! Jesus, 
                           what the hell is wrong with you? 
                She crosses to the CAB. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           You’re right, I’m sorry, I’ve been 
                           an idiot, but please don’t leave! 
                           My hotel’s not far, we could have 
                           one more drink, just a drink...
                               (she slams the CAB door)
                           I don’t want to be on my own 
                           tonight, I can’t be, and there 
                           isn’t anyone else. Just sit with 
                           me. Don’t leave me alone!
                She indicates the BOX OF ASHES -

                           You’re not alone.
                 - and with that the CAB drives off. 
        90      EXT. BROADWAY, MANHATTAN 1982 - NIGHT                      90
                And now PATRICK, furious and ashamed and thwarted, strides 
                back to the hotel, the BOX clutched to his chest. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           Death and destruction, shame and 
                           violence, ungovernable shame and 
                           violence...
                From this point on, PATRICK2 is barely sane. 
        91      INT. HOTEL SUITE, DRAKE HOTEL, MANHATTAN 1982 - NIGHT      91
                - BURSTING into the hotel room, which is magically neat and 
                tidy once again. He wrenches off the eye-patch (redness still 
                there, but less prominent). There’s a manic spite to him, a 
                dangerous lack of control, as he - 
                - hurls the BOX of ashes against the wall. 
                - kicks it across the room.
                In the BATHROOM, he uses the lid of the toilet cistern, 
                trying to crack it open, but breaking the lid instead.
                                     PATRICK2
                           I’m going to flush you down the 
                           loo, send you to the sewers with 
                           the alligators and the shit...
                He bangs at the BOX with an ICE-BUCKET, levering if off with 
                ICE-TONGS. No good. 
                He hurls it back into the bedroom, jumps on the BOX again and 
                again, throws it at the wall - 
                - then finally he picks up the BOX, hurls it at the window - 
                But it bounces off the double glazing, bounces and lands once 
                more at his feet. Invulnerable. 
                Instead, self-destruction. He crosses to the glass, presses 
                his body against it, feeling at the edges, searching for a 
                way of opening the window. 
                                     PATRICK2 (CONT’D)
                           Open up! Open, damnit. What’s the 
                           point of a fucking window if you 
                           can’t -

                Thirty-three floors, straight down to the street. A flash, a 
                fleeting image of -

                The deep, deep well, a circle of sunlight at the bottom. 
                YOUNG PATRICK climbs up so that he is standing on the edge of 
                the well. 
                He tests the air with his toe. The invitation of the 
                emptiness - 
        93      INT. HOTEL SUITE, DRAKE HOTEL, MANHATTAN 1982 - NIGHT      93
                With shaking hands, PATRICK empties his remaining stash of 
                drugs out onto the coffee table, scooping them into a pile. 
                Heroin, cocaine, Quaalude, Valium, speed, alcohol. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           Over-associative, over-accelerated, 
                           sedation, scalpel. Anaesthetic 
                           first, surely Doctor? 
                               (DAVID1’S VOICE)
                           No, PATRICK1. Scalpel first, 
                           anaesthetic afterwards - 
                PATRICK2 sets a bottle of whisky up, a glass, and begins -
                Crawling across the floor of the wrecked room, still in his 
                coat and eye patch he lifts the SOFA and crawls beneath it, 
                the SOFA lying on his chest now.
                                     PATRICK2 (CONT’D)
                           There. Nobody can find you here. 
                           But what if nobody finds me here?
                The sound of a key in the lock -
                Terrified, he peeks from beneath the frills of the sofa. 
                Someone has entered the room. A pair of brogues, a battered 
                suitcase. PATRICK2 holds his breath, terrified - 
                                     DAVID2 (V.O.)
                           Good God, what an appalling dump. 
                           You see what I’m reduced to?
                Another figure enters, the white tennis shoes of a NINE YEAR-
                OLD BOY, and now we are in - 
        94      INT. HOTEL ROOM, PROVENCE 1968 - DAY                       94
                Mediterranean light. Twin beds too close together. No faces 
                here, just the voices -

                           ELEANOR1 will be delighted. I 
                           can see her gloating, when you 
                           report back. Do you report back?
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                           Perhaps we could find somewhere 
                           else. Perhaps we could - 
                                     DAVID2
                           No, we must live within our means! 
                           This will do. Now - 
                               (the beds)
                           -left or right? 
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                           Don’t mind. 
                DAVID2 removes his shoes. 
                YOUNG PATRICK2 is rigid, terrified, doing all he can not to 
                run from the room. 
                                     DAVID2
                           I’m a very tired man. Come and talk 
                           to me, PATRICK2. 
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                           I have to -
                                     DAVID2
                           PATRICK2. Come and talk to your dear 
                           DAVID2. Please...
                YOUNG PATRICK2 closes the door.

                Drug debris - remnants of everything he has taken. Now he 
                prepares a speedball, hands shaking.
                The hit is stronger than anything he has taken so far, and 
                the force of it knocks him backwards on to the floor. 
                He closes his eyes. 
                Fade to black -

                In C.U., our first sight of ELEANOR MELROSE. An attractive 
                woman, nervous and neurotic, here wide-eyed, a little 
                tearful, summoning up her bravest face. 
                But she wakes YOUNG PATRICK gently, her face close to his -
                                     ELEANOR2
                               (a whisper)
                           Hello, my darling PATRICK2. I’m so sorry 
                           to wake you. 
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                           What time is it?
                                     ELEANOR2
                           It’s very early.
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                           Are we going now?
                               (ELEANOR2 nods)
                           Shall I pack my bag?
                ELEANOR2 kisses him lightly on the forehead. He wraps his arms 
                around her and we -

                DAWN
                Slam back into the present. 
                MANHATTAN’S DAWN LIGHT shines through the bathroom window on 
                the bathtub.
                MUSIC UP - ‘I’LL BE YOUR MIRROR’ BY THE VELVET UNDERGROUND.
                A HAND grabs at the rim. PATRICK2 wakes up in the bath. 
                There’s blood on the white porcelain. He sits. Still alive. 
                Just. There’s a breeze on his face, sounds from the street 
                below - 
        98      INT. HOTEL SUITE, DRAKE HOTEL, MANHATTAN 1982 - DAY        98
                Pulling a dressing gown around him, he walks into the suite 
                and takes in the mayhem that he has caused.
                He shuffles over to the drawn curtains which move slightly in 
                the breeze. He opens them and discovers that the window has 
                finally been opened. 
                He looks out at the milky light, at the street, 33 floors 
                below, hesitates, and closes it then.

                MUSIC CONTINUES. All of PATRICK2’s best clothes are rolled 
                into a tight bundle and rammed into a suitcase.

                Once again, PATRICK bends the needles against the white 
                tiles. He wraps them in toilet paper, throws them in the bin. 
                The eye-patch, the spoon, the empty wraps all go.

                PATRICK follows the elderly BELL-BOY down the corridor. 
                Exhausted, humbled, more muted now.

                           Life’s not just a bag of shit, but 
                           a leaky one. You can’t help being 
                           touched by it. Don’t you find?

                           I believe, sir, that’s the common

                           And they shall have a point. They 
                           shall have a very good point.

                THE RECEPTIONIST hands over the bill. An astronomical sum. 
                PATRICK takes out the envelope of cash, takes out the last of 
                his pile of bills.
                                     PATRICK2
                           Well, no-one can say I don’t know

                           Sir! Mr. PATRICK2, sir!
                               (THE BOX)
                           You nearly forgot this!
                                     PATRICK2
                           Or did I?
                                     BELL-BOY
                           Sir?
                                     PATRICK2
                           What I mean is - no need to call 
                           Vienna!
                               (taking the BOX, tipping)
                           Thank you very much. Rivers of 
                           blood, eh?
                                     BELL-BOY
                               (still uncomprehending)
                           Sir?
                                     PATRICK2
                               (a beat)
                           Never mind. Never mind. 
                And with the BOX under his arm, he walks out into the 
                bleaching white light of the Manhattan morning. MUSIC UP -

                And now he sits on the leather chair in the departure lounge, 
                the BOX held on his lap. 
                His foot starts to tap, his hand clenching and unclenching...

                A moment, a decision. PATRICK2 puts the BOX on the seat next 
                to him and walks smartly towards a bank of public telephones. 
                He fumbles in his pocket, all bills gone now, quarters and 
                dimes.

                He dials the number, pumps in the coins. The phone rings, and 
                rings...
                                     PATRICK2

                           PATRICK2, how are you!
                                     PATRICK2
                           I’m fine. I tried to kill myself 
                           last night - 
                                     JOHNNY1
                           I see. Where are you calling from?
                                     PATRICK2
                           Oh, the bottom.
                And there it is - a realisation. Unsure whether to laugh or 
                cry, he starts to do both.
                                     JOHNNY1
                           PATRICK2?
                                     PATRICK2
                           I don’t have long, can you hear me? 
                           I’ve decided, I’m going to take 
                           control of my life. I’m going to 
                           get clean.
                               (silence)
                           Can you hear me?
                                     JOHNNY1
                           I can. Are you sure this time?
                                     PATRICK2

                           So what do you want to do instead?
                               (In the silence, PATRICK2 
                                starts to cry.)

                A TELEPHONE RINGS, a loud, persistent electronic trill - 
                                                                  FADE IN:
        1       INT. HALLWAY, ENNISMORE GARDENS, LONDON 1982 - DAY          1
                The telephone rings in the hallway of a rather scruffy flat, 
                curtains drawn against the May sunlight.
                PATRICK MELROSE, a little unsteady, walks to the phone -
                                     PATRICK2
                           Hello. Hello?

                               (well-spoken, distant)
                           Patrick2? Hello, Patrick2 is that 
                           you?
                                     PATRICK2
                           Nicholas1? 
                                     NICHOLAS1 (O.S.)
                           Patrick2, I’m afraid I have rather 
                           bad news.
                PATRICK2 doesn’t move. His face entirely impassive.
                                     NICHOLAS1 (CONT’D)
                           Hello? Hello, Patrick2? Can you hear 
                           me? I’m in New York. There appears 
                           to be a delay. Can you hear me? It 
                           concerns DAVID1.
        2       INT. MOURNING SUITE, FRANK E. MACDONALD’S, NYC 1982 - DAY   2
                MUSIC up: ‘SUMMERTIME’ from PORGY and BESS, the Paul Robeson 
                recording from the 1930s. In C.U. DAVID MELROSE. 
                He lies in the mourning suite. PATRICK MELROSE is leaving the 
                room, just as in BAD NEWS, but this time we stay with the 
                body in its open coffin. 
        3       INT. CORRIDOR, FRANK E MACDONALD’S, NYC 1982 - DAY          3
                And now the lid slides into place.
                The COFFIN is wheeled along the corridor on a gurney, then 
                into an industrial lift -

        4       INT. CREMATION ROOM, NYC 1982 - DAY                         4
                - then into the furnace. The flames of the pilot lights 
                flicker, the door is closed. A roar as the flames engulf the 
                body. 
        5       INT. CREMATION ROOM, NYC 1982 - DAY                         5
                And now here is THE BOX which PATRICK carried in ‘BAD NEWS’. 
                Grey ASH is poured into the container, the lid screwed shut.
        6       INT. HOTEL SUITE, MANHATTAN NYC 1982 - DAY                  6
                And now THE BOX lies on the carpet of PATRICK’s wrecked hotel 
                suite, as he KICKS the BOX against the wall, hurls it against 
                the window -
                ‘SUMMERTIME’ continues - 
        7       INT. JFK DEPARTURE LOUNGE, NYC 1982 - DAY                   7
                And now THE BOX, battered and scratched, is on PATRICK’s lap -
                - until he suddenly gets up, and walks away, leaving THE BOX 
                alone on the chair. The inscription on the plate - ‘DAVID 
                MELROSE, 1906-1982’ PATRICK returns, snatches it up.
                CUT TO titles, WHITE ON BLACK: 
                                         ‘NEVER MIND’
        8       EXT. THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 1967 - MORNING                    8
                The heat of summer. In extreme C.U., a fat, juicy FIG rots in 
                the bright, bright sun. Other figs lie nearby, some fresh, 
                others old and squashed, sucked at by wasps.
                The large fig tree overshadows the terrace of an exquisite 
                Provencal house - ‘le chateau’ to locals, a mere ‘farmhouse’ 
                to the owners. MUSIC - piano this time. 
        9       INT. DRAWING ROOM, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 1967 - MORNING      9
                Fingers on a keyboard in a darkened room, curtains drawn 
                against the sun. DAVID2 MELROSE, 60 here, improvises around 
                the theme. Wild music in a minor key, harsh flurries of high 
                notes, superimposed on a rumbling military march. Virtuosic.
                The drawing room in which DAVID2 plays is dim and valuable and 
                rich, heavy curtains drawn against the sun. Exquisite items; 
      Patrick Melrose - 'Never Mind' - Ep 2                                3
                delicate Louis Quinze chairs, Chinese vases, an intricately 
                carved Doge’s chair, drawings by Guardi and Tiepolo and 
                Novelli. A museum store-room, the spoils of the Jonson 
                family’s acquisitive raids on old Europe. 
                He is dressed in yellow and white flannel pyjamas from Bond 
                Street, frayed now, the sole inheritance from his own father. 
                Suddenly he stops playing, eyes hardening. He has heard 
                something - 
                                     DAVID2
                           Patrick1?
                More clearly now, the tinkle of glass.  He reaches for his 
                sunglasses, and the cigar that smoulders in the saucer of a 
                delicate bone china tea-cup. 
        10      EXT. TERRACE, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 1967 - MORNING          10
                YVETTE, the MAID, 70, staggers with a heavy tray loaded high 
                with wine glasses and expensive china-ware. 
                                     DAVID2
                           Yvette! It’s you!
                She stops, dips. DAVID2 is all smiles, all charm.
                                     YVETTE
                           Monsieur Melrose. I was making the 
                           table ready. For this evening - 
                                     DAVID2
                           Ah yes. A beautiful day. I sense

                           Any sign of my ELEANOR1? Has 
                           she risen, like the sun, to cast 
                           her golden rays on us?

                               (the tray is heavy)
                           Not yet, monsieur.
                                     DAVID2
                           And PATRICK1. I hoped to spend the 
                           day with him. 
                                     YVETTE
                               (a sweat breaking now)
                           He’s playing, monsieur. 
      Patrick Melrose - 'Never Mind' - Ep 2                                4
                Elderly YVETTE’s arms are shaking, the delicate glasses 
                RATTLING against each other. Perspiration on her forehead.
                                     DAVID2
                           Everyone seems to be hiding from me 
                           this morning.
                DAVID2 watches her discomfort, smiling, smiling...
                The rattle increases. Surely she will drop the tray. He 
                watches...
                And watches...
                                     DAVID2 (CONT’D)
                           Well. Be careful with my ELEANOR1’s 
                           china, it’s extremely valuable. 
                And YVETTE, shaken, makes her escape.
                                     DAVID2 (CONT’D)
                           And if you see my son, please send 
                           him my way!
        11      EXT. VINEYARD, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 1967 - MORNING         11
                A BLUR OF MOTION through broken vines, as a YOUNG BOY tumbles 
                down the serried terraces that cover the steep slope beneath 
                the chateau. 
                Laughing, hollering, there’s something reckless and wild 
                about YOUNG PATRICK2 MELROSE here, eight years-old, fearless 
                and brave, slashing at the vines left and right with his 
                wooden stick, leaping over the terraced walls, flying almost. 
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                           Off with your head!
                He decapitates a flower.
        12      EXT. WOODS, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 1967 - MORNING            12
                In a clearing stands a WELL, its wooden cover pushed to one 
                side. Approaching, YOUNG PATRICK picks up a rock which he 
                carries with two hands to the edge of the well. 
                He peers into the blackness, fascinated and horrified; the 
                invitation of the emptiness.
                Then he pushes the rock.
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                           1..2..3..4..
      Patrick Melrose - 'Never Mind' - Ep 2                                5
                Finally, the splash. He hoists himself up on to the wall and 
                attempts to drag the wooden cover back in place over the top 
                of the well, the rotten wood crumbling in his hand. 
                The cover is in place. PATRICK steps gingerly on to it until 
                he stands in the centre...
        13      INT. ELEANOR2’S BEDROOM, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 1967 - MORNING13
                ELEANOR MELROSE2, DAVID1’s wife lies in bed, eyes concealed 
                behind a mask, perspiration on her forehead, nursing her 
                habitual hangover.  
                                     DAVID2 (O.S.)
                           Eleanor2! Patrick1! Where is everyone 
                           hiding?
                She peels back the eye-mask. An attractive woman, fifteen 
                years her husband’s junior, but nervous, neurotic.  She sits. 
        14      INT. WOODS, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 1967 - MORNING            14
                YOUNG PATRICK tests the rotting wood with his foot.
                Then jumps.
                Then jumps again.
                And again, higher this time, testing the strength of the 
                rotten wood, a kind of elation in his face as he jumps higher 
                and higher, the wood creaking and bowing dangerously beneath 
                his feet - 
        15      INT. ELEANOR’S BATHROOM/BEDROOM, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 1967 - 15
                MORNING
                ELEANOR2’s morning ritual; she opens a medicine cabinet, takes 
                a yellow pill, a white pill, swallows them with last night’s 
                brandy, swallows one more of each, places a number of 
                medicine bottles in her capacious handbag, brushes her teeth, 
                powders her sweating brow. Huge, expensive dark glasses 
                conceal her darting red eyes, and now, finally, she braces 
                herself to leave the safety of her bedroom. 
        16      INT/EXT. BEDROOM, GUEST HOUSE, LACOSTE 1967 - MORNING      16
                P.O.V. through the window as YOUNG PATRICK2 walks towards the 
                house. ANNE2 MOORE should be reading - Suetonius’ Twelve 
                Caesars, an old leather-bound edition - but the boy is more 
                interesting. 
                We’ve met Anne before, as Patrick’s sympathetic New York 
                friend in Episode One.

                                     VICTOR (V.O.)
                           ANNE2! ANNE are you up yet? ANNE!
                She picks the book up again quickly. In the doorway stands 
                SIR VICTOR EISEN, sixty years-old, eminent philosopher, 
                barrel-chested. A dishevelled, Edwardian air. ‘Boyfriend’ 
                doesn’t seem the right term, though that’s what he is.
                                     VICTOR
                           Who are you on?
                                     ANNE2
                           Caligula, appropriately enough.
                                     VICTOR
                           Well, breakfast now.
                                     ANNE2
                           Oh, darling, you shouldn’t have.
                                     VICTOR
                           Have what?
                                     ANNE2
                           Made breakfast.
                                     VICTOR
                           No, I mean I’m ready for my 
                           breakfast.
                And he’s gone. ANNE2 narrows her eyes at the door, and rises.
        17      INT. BEDROOM, CLABON MEWS, LONDON 1967 - MORNING           17
                - and we’re in Chelsea, where NICHOLAS2 PRATT, 43, and BRIDGET2 
                WATSON-SCOTT, 20, are fucking - there really is no other word 
                for it - in the bedroom of his mews house. Clothing, 
                ashtrays, champagne bottles litter the floor - a morning-
                after feel. BRIDGET2 reaches for a joint that burns in an 
                ashtray. She takes a puff. 
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           Do you mind waiting until I’ve 
                           finished? Christ -
                                     BRIDGET2
                           Sorry!
                She puts it in the ashtray, turns the alarm clock to face 
                her. 
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           You know that’s a real turn-on, you 
                           reaching for the clock like that. 
                                     BRIDGET2
                           What time’s the taxi?
      Patrick Melrose - 'Never Mind' - Ep 2                                7
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           You might help out here. Move 
                           around a little -
                                     BRIDGET2
                           If we miss our flight - 
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           Oh, what’s the bloody point. 
                And he clambers off her, sits on the edge of the bed, 
                appraises himself in the mirror. 
                                     NICHOLAS2 (CONT’D)
                               (he finds BRIDGET2’s powder 
                                in her bag, dabs it on 
                                his nose)
                           Ruined beauty. It won’t be long 
                           before people say ‘he used to be so 
                           handsome.’
                                     BRIDGET2
                           Oh, you still are.
                                     NICHOLAS2
                               (Geordie accent, of sorts)
                           Give over, luv, give over.
                                     BRIDGET2
                           Don’t do that though. 
                The door buzzes. 
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           Christ, there’s the taxi. 
                And he staggers off towards the bathroom. BRIDGET stretches 
                languorously. 
                                     BRIDGET2
                           Where are we going this time?
                                     NICHOLAS2 (O.S.)
                           I’ve told you. The South of France!
        18      INT. DRAWING ROOM/HALLWAY, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 1967 -     18
                MORNING
                And now ELEANOR tiptoes through the corridor, arriving at the 
                door where DAVID sits and plays. She hurries past, a prisoner 
                escaping the beam of a searchlight -
                DAVID notes her escape. He stops playing, knowing that she 
                will freeze in her tracks. She does so...
                INTERCUT. DAVID smiles. He plays again. ELEANOR tiptoes on.
      Patrick Melrose - 'Never Mind' - Ep 2                                8
                He stops.
                She stops too, holding her breath.
                And now he is behind her. Kind, civil, attentive. 
                                     DAVID2
                           Where are you off to?
                                     ELEANOR2
                           To pick NICHOLAS1 up from the 
                           airport.
                                     DAVID2
                           There’s hours yet.
                                     ELEANOR2
                           I wanted a drive. With ANNE1. I 
                           promised.
                                     DAVID2
                           I see. You’ll leave PATRICK1 here.
                                     ELEANOR2
                           Of course. 
                                     DAVID2
                           You remember our discussion.
                                     ELEANOR2
                           Of course.
                                     DAVID2
                           Well. His flight lands at two. Off 
                           you go.
                And she hurries away - 
        19      INT. KITCHEN, GUEST HOUSE, LACOSTE 1967 - MORNING          19
                ANNE puts away the last few breakfast things as VICTOR 
                stands, ready to leave.
                                     VICTOR
                           It just seems a little rude, that’s 
                           all. We are his guests.
                                     ANNE2
                           I’m sorry, I’d no idea there’d be  
                           a test. 
                                     VICTOR
                           With DAVID1 Melrose there’s always a 
                           test. It’s a good idea to prepare 
                           something intelligent to say.

                               (as they leave)
                           Did you know Caligula tortured his 
                           wife to find out why he was so 
                           devoted to her? What’s DAVID1’s 
                           excuse, I wonder?
        20      EXT. GUEST HOUSE, LACOSTE 1967 - CONTINUOUS                20
                The cottage is in the grounds, a safe distance from DAVID1. 
                They walk towards the main house.
                                     ANNE2
                           And what’s in this for you, Sir 
                           Victor? If you’re so scared of him -
                                     VICTOR
                           I’m not scared of him. I find him 
                           fascinating, that’s all. At Eton DAVID1 
                           was an extraordinarily gifted young 
                           man, very distinguished. Held in 
                           awe. 
                                     ANNE2
                           When I was at college, the football 
                           heroes got to sleep with the 
                           cheerleaders. At Eton, they got to 
                           beat young boys for burning the 
                           toast.
                                     VICTOR
                           He didn’t beat me exactly. The 
                           important thing is we’re friends 
                           now, and also his guests.
                                     ANNE2
                           Well I’m sure it’s very American of 
                           me, but I fail to see what’s so 
                           glamorous about lost promise. 
                           ‘Distinguished’ for what? For doing 
                           nothing for a long time in the same 
                           place.
                                     VICTOR
                           Please God, don’t say that -
                                     ANNE2
                           The only one I like is PATRICK1... 
        21      EXT. TERRACE/DRIVEWAY, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 1967 - DAY     21
                YOUNG PATRICK runs full pelt towards his mother. 
                                     ANNE (V.O.)
                           At least he still has a little life 
                           in him -
      Patrick Melrose - 'Never Mind' - Ep 2                               10
                Stepping outside, ELEANOR shields her eyes from the morning 
                blaze.
                                     ELEANOR
                           PATRICK2, where on earth have you 
                           been? DAVID1’s been calling.
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                           Can we play now?
                                     ELEANOR2
                           Not now - 
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                           But you said we could -
                                     ELEANOR2
                           Darling, I have to pick NICHOLAS1 up 
                           from the airport, there’s nothing I 
                           can do about it - 
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                           You promised!
                                     ELEANOR2
                           Au revoir! A bientot!
                A beat, and YOUNG PATRICK2 follows after ELEANOR2.
                A beautiful maroon BUICK parked beneath a pine tree. Pure 
                Americana, bizarre in this setting. She sets about wiping 
                resin from the windscreen.
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                           Can I come with you then? 
                                     ELEANOR2
                           No! DAVID1 wants you here with 
                           him. 
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                           I’ll stay in the car, I won’t say a 
                           word.
                A moment, and she kneels, takes his hand. 
                                     ELEANOR2
                           It sounds strange but DAVID1 
                           gets jealous. DAVID1 thinks it’s very 
                           important that you’re not too  
                           dependant on me. You mustn’t prefer 
                           my company to his. 
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                           I do.
      Patrick Melrose - 'Never Mind' - Ep 2                               11
                                     ELEANOR2
                           Well you mustn’t let on. Please, 
                           not that look -
                               (a kiss on the forehead)
                           If you’re nice to DAVID1, then you can 
                           come and find me before dinner, 
                           tell me about your day and I’ll 
                           tell you about mine and I promise, 
                           I swear, you will have my full 
                           attention.
                She sees ANNE2 and VICTOR arrive, and switches into her 
                hostess mode. Kisses on the cheek -
                                     ELEANOR2 (CONT’D)
                           Ah, here you are! You’re just in 
                           time. I hope you’re comfortable in 
                           the cottage. I’d have put you in 
                           the house but you know how DAVID1 
                           hates having to share anything with 
                           anyone, even air. At dinner, he’ll 
                           be all over you, I’m sure.
                                     ANNE2
                           Patrick, are you coming with us? I 
                           do hope so! 
                                     ELEANOR2
                           No! No, American girls only, I’m 
                           afraid. 
                             ANNE2                      ELEANOR2 (CONT'D)
                I’m sure we could make an        Victor, aren’t you terribly 
                excepti-                         hot? Have you finished 
                                                 writing your book?
                VICTOR puffs up, pleased to be fulfilling his role.
                                     VICTOR
                           Not quite. Identity is such a big 
                           subject and -  
                                     ELEANOR2
                           Forget it, you’ve already lost me, 
                           Victor - 
                And in fumbling for the keys, she drops her bag. Bottles of 
                pills roll out, along with a hip-flask. ANNE2 notes them, 
                alarmed. Inside the car -
                                     ANNE2
                           Perhaps I should drive. 
                                     ELEANOR2
                           No-one else can drive this car! 
                           It’s the one thing that’s still 
                           mine alone.
      Patrick Melrose - 'Never Mind' - Ep 2                               12
                                     ANNE2
                           But it is rather a long way. 
                                     ELEANOR2
                           Not the way I drive. 
                And with a look of terrible trepidation, ANNE2 climbs in the 
                car, leaving YOUNG PATRICK2 and VICTOR awkwardly alone.
                VICTOR is not a natural with children.
                YOUNG PATRICK2 is not a natural with adults.
                                     VICTOR
                           Well, young man, what have you been 
                           up to -
                The car leaves. YOUNG PATRICK2 turns and walks away. From the 
                house, the sound of the piano.
        22      INT. HALLWAY, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 1967 - DAY              22
                The house is cool after the morning sun. There’s a pause in 
                the music, then a new melody. The piece of music we’ve heard 
                before, Patrick’s theme. He peeks somewhat nervously into the 
                room -
                                     DAVID2 (O.S.)
                           I know you’re there. 
                YOUNG PATRICK2 enters -
        23      INT. DRAWING ROOM, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 1967 - DAY         23
                                     DAVID2
                           Hello, Mr. PATRICK2. Have they 
                           all gone?
                               (YOUNG PATRICK2 nods)
                           Good. We’ll have our special day. 
                           Recognise this? 
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                           You wrote it for me. 
                And YOUNG PATRICK2 steps forward, a little more at ease.
                                     DAVID2
                           When I left Eton, my father asked 
                           me what do you want to do with your 
                           life? I didn’t dare tell him I 
                           wanted to compose music. ‘I don’t 
                           know, sir’ I said. What did he say?
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                               (a routine)
                           ‘Better join the army.’
      Patrick Melrose - 'Never Mind' - Ep 2                               13
                He stops playing abruptly, turns, regards YOUNG PATRICK2.
                                     DAVID2
                           What will you do with your life, I 
                           wonder?
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                           I don’t know, DAVID2.
                DAVID2 regards his son fondly. He places his cigar in the 
                ashtray, stands. Into another routine -
                                     DAVID2
                           Shall I pick you up by the ears?
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                           No!
                Meaning ‘yes’. He’s delighted - they’ve done this before.
                                     DAVID2
                           Come here.
                DAVID2 holds onto his son’s ears. YOUNG PATRICK2 holds onto his 
                DAVID2’s wrists. 
                                     DAVID2 (CONT’D)
                           Ready?
                And DAVID2 lifts, taking PATRICK2’S weight in his wrists, 
                giving the illusion that he’s shaking him by his ears alone. 
                They both laugh at the game - they’ve done this before. 
                                     DAVID2 (CONT’D)
                           Now let go!
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                           No. 
                                     DAVID2
                           Let go and I’ll drop you. 
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                           No!
                                     DAVID2
                           Trust me! On three. Are you ready? 
                           1, 2...
                YOUNG PATRICK2 lets go.
                But DAVID2 does not drop him.
                And for one awful, suspended moment he really is holding 
                PATRICK2 only by the ears. PATRICK2 wails, snatches his 
                DAVID2’s wrists, his legs kicking the air. 
      Patrick Melrose - 'Never Mind' - Ep 2                               14
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                           Put me down! Put me down!
                                     DAVID2
                           You’ve learnt a very important 
                           lesson today. Think for yourself. 
                           Never let other people make 
                           important decisions for you. Do you 
                           understand? Understand!
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                           Yes!
                               (he drops him)
                           You lied! You hurt me!
                                     DAVID2
                           And don’t whimper. It’s very 
                           unattractive. 
                YOUNG PATRICK2 escapes from the room - 
                And for a moment, DAVID2’s supreme control falters. Regret, a 
                kind of petulant remorse battles with his fury at his son’s 
                departure. His breathing becomes a little more ragged.
                He takes up his cigar, puts his hand to the keyboard, winces - 
                                     NICHOLAS2 (V.O.)
                           Of course DAVID1 doesn’t have a 
                           penny. His terrible father cut him 
                           off. Left him nothing but a pair of 
                           old pyjamas -
                His fingers are twisted and curled like talons. He rubs at 
                them, and stands sharply -
        24      INT. TAXI, LONDON 1967 - DAY                               24
                NICHOLAS2, slumped in the back of the black-cab,

                           Daring to defy DAVID1becoming a 
                           doctor. Before that, he wanted to 
                           be a composer. Could’ve too. Don’t 
                           stare at his hands.

                ELEANOR2’s uppers are kicking in, and she drives with manic 
                ebullience through the vineyards. ANNE2 clings on -

                           ELEANOR1, on the other hand, comes 
                           from one of the richest families in 
                           America. All new money of course, 
                           from the patent on a dry-cleaning 
                           fluid, but completely loaded. She 
                           was quite a catch, young ELEANOR1, 
                           for someone like DAVID1.

                           Of course she wasn’t drunk in those 
                           days, just very shy and nervous -

                A reprise of the earlier shot - a fat, juicy FIG rots. 
                DAVID stalks out of the drawing room and across the terrace, 
                his fingers tensing and twisting in pain and fury.
                                     NICHOLAS2 (V.O.)
                           The house was the first thing DAVID1 
                           persuaded ELEANOR1 to buy. First summer 
                           there, we were sitting on the 
                           terrace and ELEANOR1 complained about 
                           the terrible waste of figs which 
                           fell from the tree and rotted there 
                           when there were people starving in 
                           the world!
                Standing on the Terrace, DAVID2 sees PATRICK2 running, running 
                away from him through the vineyard. A look of cold fury.
                                     NICHOLAS2 (V.O.)
                           I saw a look come over DAVID1’s face 
                           - Christ, I hope you never get to 
                           see it. There were a lot of figs on 
                           the ground, some of them old and 
                           squashed, others with wasps dancing 
                           around them, and DAVID1 did this 
                           amazing thing.

                           He told ELEANOR1 to get on all fours 
                           and eat all the figs off the 
                           ground...

                           Yes, ELANOR1 did look a little 
                           confused. And - what’s the word - 
                           betrayed. ELEANOR1 didn’t protest 
                           though. Just ate every single one.

                           You don’t cross DAVID1 when he’s in 
                           that sort of mood.

                The BUICK has come to a halt behind a tractor. In the 
                vineyards, WORKERS picking the grapes. 
                                     ELEANOR2
                           Now that’s a meaningful life -

                           Like a Red Indian or something. 
                           Rising with the sun, living off the 
                           land, connected to the earth, and 
                           if you want a chicken, you have to 
                           strangle it yourself.

                           Sounds idyllic.
                                     ELEANOR2
                           This is so frustrating. 
                               (beeping the horn)
                           I wanted to stop for lunch!
                The horn blares. ANNE2, endeavouring to talk her down - 
                                     ANNE2
                           So is PATRICK1 looking forward to 
                           going back to school?
                                     ELEANOR2
                           Why do people imagine they’ll 
                           please me by asking about PATRICK1? 
                           I don’t know how he is, only he 
                           knows - 
                                     ANNE2
                           I’m sorry, I thought - 
                                     ELEANOR2
                           If you want to see him, he’ll be 
                           lurking tonight. Oh, God. Tonight. 
                           I need a drink.
                And without checking the road ahead, she jams the Buick into 
                gear and blindly pulls out past the tractor. ANNE2 covers her 
                eyes and cries out -

                The BUICK pulls up and parks in a random fashion in the 
                square of an idyllic village. ELEANOR2 stumbles out, ANNE2 
                shaken, follows. 
                                     ELEANOR2
                           Ah this is the place! Isn’t it 
                           lovely? There’s Marcel! Marcel!
                               (a hunched, seedy looking

                           After the war the Nazis shot every 
                           man in the village except Marcel, 
                           which is lucky for us because the 
                           food is wonderful.

                But it isn’t wonderful, it’s a terrible dark, gristly stew. 
                ELEANOR2 has her eyes closed, her head nodding forward into 
                her plate.
                                     ELEANOR2

                           what I need? A cognac -

                           That’s not a good idea. 
                                     ELEANOR2

                           Of course it is -
                               (a pill bottle)
                           It’s exactly what we need after all 
                           this heavy food.

                           For my headache.

                           May I speak frankly?
                                     ELEANOR2
                               (paying the bill)
                           I do hate it when people say that.

                           Obviously, it’s never possible to 
                           know exactly what goes on in a 
                           family -  
                                     ELEANOR2
                           No, it is not, especially when you 
                           are neither married nor have 
                           children yourself -

                           Merci, Marcel. 
                She takes the pill, washes it down with the cognac, then 
                starts to walk away. ANNE2 follows.

                ANNE drives, ELEANOR reclines in the seat, her eyes 
                flickering. 
                From ELEANOR’s POV we see the wonderful countryside passing 
                by, the colours now as vivid and stylised as a Van Gogh.

                FORWARD to LONDON 1982, the Westway from Heathrow, grey and 
                suburban. PATRICK lies curled in the back of JOHNNY’s car, 
                shaking and sweating - the start of withdrawal.  
                                     PATRICK
                           Oh, Christ, that hurts.

                YOUNG PATRICK, meanwhile, runs towards his hiding place, and 
                stands slashing at the vines that cover the entrance.

                DAY
                DAVID ends the music with a facetious cha-cha-cha. DAVID 
                examines his hands. Away from the keyboard, his fingers are 
                cramped with rheumatism. Not long now, and they’ll be 
                useless. Claws. Hands shaking, he unscrews the lid of a 
                bottle of pills, swallows one with pastis.
                He recalls PATRICK’s rejection. A spasm of anger. He goes 
                quickly to the window -
                                     DAVID
                           PATRICK! Come to lunch. PATRICK!

                Exhausted, his anger spent, YOUNG PATRICK sits on a stone and 
                dries his eyes.

                JOHNNY glances anxiously in the mirror.

                           PATRICK!
                PATRICK curls into a ball, clutches his stomach.

                ANNE turns on the radio - French pop - and immediately 
                ELEANOR springs instantly into life. Some neural switch has 
                been thrown. The Dexedrine has kicked in. Manic now -
                                     ELEANOR
                           Hello, hello, where are we? Yes, I 
                           remember. Hello. Goodness, that 
                           stew was awfully rich. I feel 
                           better now. Hello. HERE IT IS!
                They pass a sign. A theme park.

                           like going home -

                           Of course! Please? Ple-ease?
        40      EXT. SALOON, ‘L’OK CORRAL’, PROVENCE 1967 - DAY            40
                Bang! A French COWBOY is shot and stumbles out through the 
                saloon doors. ELEANOR, in cowboy hat, claps her hands with 
                delight!
                But with autumn looming, the amusement park has an 
                underpopulated, melancholy air, and ANNE struggles to join in 
                with ELEANOR’s glee.
                                     ELEANOR2
                           Isn’t it wonderful?

                           Does Patrick like it?
                                     ELEANOR2
                           Oh, he’s never been. Look! A Ferris 
                           Wheel!

                And now the Ferris Wheel carries them high above the theme 
                park and the surrounding countryside.

                           I’d like you to understand 
                           something.
                The isolation has made ELEANOR2 less cautious, more open.
                                     ELEANOR2 (CONT’D)
                           DAVID1 wasn’t always like he is now. 
                                     ANNE2
                           DAVID1?
                                     ELEANOR2
                           When I first met DAVID1, he played so 
                           brilliantly, he was so intelligent 
                           and beautiful, so different from 
                           all the other English snobs. We 
                           were going to do wonderful things 
                           together, useful things. Of course 
                           he was a difficult man, even then, 
                           but I thought I could turn to him. 
                           The idea of turning to him now, of 
                           being alone in the same room - 
                               (a realisation)
                           Why are we stopping?

                           I’m sure he won’t mind. A few 
                           minutes.

                           He’s absolutely right of course. 
                           Perhaps he should come to dinner.

                PATRICK, meanwhile, is hungry and a little bored now. Time to 
                venture out.
        45      INT. DRAWING ROOM, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 1967 - AFTERNOON   45
                DAVID reaches for his pastis. He notices -
                In C.U., a trail of ants crawls over the glass. Down below, 
                YVETTE is luring YOUNG PATRICK2 to lunch. DAVID2 listens in.
                                     YVETTE (O.S.)
                           PATRICK2, tu es en retard. Déjeuner!
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2 (O.S.)
                           Je ne veux pas de déjeuner!

                                     YOUNG PATRICK2 (O.S.)
                           Oui!
                DAVID2 draws on his cigar until it glows, then lightly touches 
                it against the column of ants. We go to -

                YVETTE is holding YOUNG PATRICK2’s hand, leaning in, an easy 
                intimacy.

                           possible. 
                YVETTE embraces him, kisses him, heads off. DAVID2 looks as if 
                he might explode. 
                In a sudden burst of indignation, YOUNG PATRICK2 stamps on a 
                fig. And another. He picks one up and is about to hurl it 
                when - 
                                     DAVID2

                The bedroom is austere, monkish. An exquisite, invaluable 
                Correggio painting is the only decoration. Christ in thorns. 
                DAVID2 sits beneath, kneading his rheumatic hands, shaking 
                with pain and rage.

                And he stands in the doorway. DAVID2 waits. 
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2 (CONT’D)
                           What have I done wrong?

                           Do you know who King Chaka was?

                           No. But I promise I - 
                                     DAVID2
                           King Chaka was a great and mighty 
                           Zulu warrior who made his troops 
                           stamp thorn bushes into the ground 
                           and march for days across hot 
                           jagged rocks. The soles of their 
                           feet were slashed and burnt and 
                           though there was resentment and 
                           pain at the time, the calluses this 
                           created meant that eventually 
                           nothing would harm them. They would 
                           feel no pain, and what had felt 
                           like cruelty at the time was 
                           actually a gift. It was actually 
                           love.

                you’re older you’ll be           Please tell me. I don’t

                detachment that I’ve 
                instilled -

                           Go and close the door. 
                PATRICK2 is shaking, terrified.
                In the darkness, his eye finds a GREEN LIZARD. A GECKO.
                It clambers up the wall, scampers over the window and climbs 
                along the curtain rod.

                           Do I have to close it myself?
                DAVID2 sighs, stands. We follow him as he walks slowly past 
                YOUNG PATRICK2 -

                           Very well. Take your trousers down.
                - and closes the door, with our POV outside. A moment. 
                Then we PULL OUT FROM THE CLOSED DOOR, backing away from it, 
                very slowly, just as in the funeral home in Episode One.

                From elsewhere in the house, the sound of a blow. A muffled 
                cry. An inhalation -

                Romanee-Conti at his side.

                DAVID rifles through the vast array of pills and potions in 
                ELEANOR’s  medicine cabinet. Hand-written envelopes marked 
                Seconal and Mandrax then, at last, a bottle - Opium (B.P. 0.6 
                grams).
                With some difficulty, he unscrews the lid of his bottle, 
                shakes a pellet from the bottle, then another, and washes 
                them down.

                aspirin, valium - empty. The syringe from the opening of ‘Bad 
                News’. A moment. He wraps it in tissue paper, discards it.

                Tear-stained, YOUNG PATRICK walks reluctantly towards the 
                house. The sound of a car behind him. A CAR-HORN blares. He 
                steps to one side.
                From his P.O.V., a glimpse of that other American woman - 
                ANNE is it? - holding her hand up. He holds his hand up in 
                return, and continues to walk.

                DAVID stirs from his opium sleep. His body is extremely heavy 
                and sluggish, and he reaches for the cold coffee on the table 
                at his side. Then stops - 
                On the thin, 18th century coffee cup there is a design of 
                gold and orange cockerels fighting one another, and as he 
                stares, the cockerels start to MOVE, fighting each other, 
                pecking at each other’s eyes. 
                The hallucination startles, then fascinates DAVID and he 
                drags himself to his feet and looks elsewhere in the drawing 
                room. 
                The same Objet D’Arts that we saw earlier, but now details 
                are pin-sharp, colours heightened and there is subtle 
                movement in the other antiques too - a flutter in the carved 
                wooden leaves, a slight flexing of the fingers of a crucified 
                Jesus. 
                A noise from outside, and DAVID snaps alert. The Buick on the 
                gravel - 
        61      EXT. TERRACE, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 1967 - AFTERNOON        61
                ELEANOR2 is saying goodbye to ANNE2.
                                     ELEANOR2
                           Eight o’clock. Please, please don’t 
                           be late.
                               (a whisper)
                           And let’s forget our conversation, 
                           yes?
                Somewhat concerned, ANNE2 leaves. BRIDGET2 takes in the house.

                                     BRIDGET2
                           Wow. 
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           I’ve almost forgotten how wonderful 
                           it is here. 
                                     ELEANOR2
                           I’ve completely forgotten and I 
                           live here. 
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           Oh, ELEANOR2, what a sad thing to 
                           say. Tell me it isn’t true. 
                                     ELEANOR2
                           Okay, it isn’t true.
                                     BRIDGET2
                           It’s beautiful. I want one!
                                     ELEANOR2
                           That’s what David said. We were 
                           going to turn it into a home for 
                           alcoholics. Which, in a sense, we 
                           have. Don’t touch your bags, Yvette 
                           can fetch them. 
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           I wonder where DAVID1 is?
                                     ELEANOR2
                               (brightly)
                           Perhaps he’s drowned in the bath! 
                           I’ll find Yvette.
                And she goes. BRIDGET2 wanders off, NICHOLAS2 following. 
                                     BRIDGET2
                               (giggling)
                           She’s really high. 
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           Do you think you might possibly 
                           buck up and make a little light 
                           conversation? Something other than 
                           how vivid the colours are -
                                     BRIDGET2
                           Is this it?
                                     NICHOLAS
                           What?
                                     BRIDGET2
                           The fig tree. Is it the same one?
      Patrick Melrose - 'Never Mind' - Ep 2                               32
                NICHOLAS2 puts his fingers to his lips, but to his horror 
                smirking BRIDGET2 kneels and crawls on all fours amongst the 
                fallen figs. 
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           Get up! Get up, d’you hear me? If 
                           DAVID2 sees you...
                From the balcony, unseen, DAVID2 watches and listens, his face 
                a mask. NICHOLAS2 yanks her to her feet. 
                                     BRIDGET2
                           Why are you all so scared of him? 
                           What d’you think he’s going to do 
                           to you, Nicholas?
                                     DAVID2 (O.C.)
                           I thought I heard someone!
                Startled, they turn to find their host smiling down benignly 
                from the high terrace. 
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           DAVID2! How nice to see you! This is  
                           Bridget Watson-Scott.
                                     DAVID2
                           Hello, my dear. 
                                     BRIDGET2
                           You have the most wonderful spot 
                           here!
                                     DAVID2
                           Yes, just think, with a single 
                           machine gun mounted here you could 
                           dominate the whole valley. Stay 
                           there, I’ll come down. We’ll have 
                           tea beneath the fig tree.
        62      EXT. TERRACE, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 1967 - AFTERNOON        62
                YVETTE pours tea for BRIDGET2, slumped in a deck chair. 
                                     BRIDGET2
                           What a civilised life you have!
                NICHOLAS2 rolls his eyes. 
                                     DAVID2
                           Tell me, are you going to more 
                           weddings or memorials these days?
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           I still go to weddings, but I enjoy 
                           the memorials more. 
      Patrick Melrose - 'Never Mind' - Ep 2                               33
                                     DAVID2
                           Because you don’t have to bring a 
                           present. One should only go to an 
                           enemy’s memorial. There’s the 
                           pleasure of outliving them, but 
                           also an opportunity for a truce. 
                           Forgiveness is so important, don’t 
                           you think, BRIDGET2?
                                     BRIDGET2
                           Gosh, yes. Especially getting other 
                           people to forgive you. 
                The remark hangs for a moment. 
                                     DAVID2
                           But why would I need anyone’s 
                           forgiveness?
                BRIDGET2 is saved by ELEANOR2’s arrival. 
                                     ELEANOR2
                           How can you sit in the sun? It’s so 
                           bright!
                And with perfect civility, DAVID2 arranges the chair.
                                     BRIDGET2
                           Careful not to squash the figs. 
                ELEANOR2 - a momentary spasm. From DAVID2, arranging her chair - 
                nothing. BRIDGET2 picks one off the floor. NICHOLAS2 tenses.
                                     BRIDGET2 (CONT’D)
                           Isn’t it weird, the way the skin is 
                           purple and white at the same time?
                                     DAVID2
                           Like a drunk with emphysema.
                                     BRIDGET2
                           This one...this one is perfect. 
                And, provocatively, she rounds her lips and eats the fig. 
                All watch her. ELEANOR2 frozen, NICHOLAS2 fraught. Only DAVID2 
                moves, removing his sunglasses slowly.
                The effect of the opium can be seen in his eyes, which he 
                fixes on BRIDGET, a duel that she can only lose. She stands 
                suddenly, crosses to the balcony -
                                     BRIDGET2 (CONT’D)
                           Goodness, look! There’s a strange 
                           little boy.
                                     ELEANOR2
                           That’s our son, PATRICK1. 
      Patrick Melrose - 'Never Mind' - Ep 2                               34
                                     BRIDGET2
                           You have kids? Wow!
                YOUNG PATRICK. From his POV now - 
                                     ELEANOR2
                           PATRICK2! PATRICK2, come and say 
                           hello! Darling, we’re having tea!
                DAVID2 steps in to view and YOUNG PATRICK2 recoils. 
                                     DAVID2
                           Patrick, come and join us!
                                     BRIDGET2
                           Perhaps he can’t hear you.
                                     ELEANOR2
                           Of course he can. He’s just being 
                           tiresome. 
                                     BRIDGET2
                           God, children are so sweet. Little 
                           boy! Hello!
                ELEANOR’s had enough. 
                                     ELEANOR2
                           Let me show you to your room, so 
                           you can get ready.
                YOUNG PATRICK2 watches as the adults follow into the house, 
                his father glancing behind him. 
        63      INT. DRAWING ROOM, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 1967 - AFTERNOON   63
                Late afternoon now and NICHOLAS2 and DAVID2 smoke cigars and 
                drink champagne. 
                                     DAVID2
                               (toasting)
                           ‘Only the best or go without.’ 
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           Always, provided we don’t have to 
                           go without.
                                     DAVID2
                           She’s very....vivacious.
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           BRIDGET1? She’ll do for now. 
      Patrick Melrose - 'Never Mind' - Ep 2                               35
                                     DAVID2
                           Don’t apologise, she’s charming. 
                In the corridor, YOUNG PATRICK2 prepares to make his way 
                upstairs to ELEANOR2. Intercut -
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           Sometimes I think I should be done 
                           with it and settle down with a well-
                           bred, well-educated, well-informed 
                           woman whose conversation I can 
                           bear. Then I remember I’ve divorced 
                           two of them already.
                And we stay with YOUNG PATRICK2 as he climbs the stairs to his 
                mother’s room, where he’ll be safe - 
                                     DAVID2
                           PATRICK2. Where are you going?
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                           ELEANOR1 wanted to see me.
                                     DAVID2
                           ELEANOR1’s tired after her drive. Come 
                           and say hello to your godfather. 
                YOUNG PATRICK turns and walks slowly down the stairs. 
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           Hello, PAREICK2. Up to mischief are 
                           you? 
                                     DAVID2
                           Almost certainly. 
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           That’s what I like to hear. 
                DAVID2 is kind and tender with his son, but something has 
                changed. NICHOLAS2 loiters. 
                                     DAVID2
                               (kindly)
                           Everything all right?
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                               (terrified, confused)
                           Yes, DAVID2
                                     DAVID2
                           We know you didn’t eat lunch. Did 
                           you have tea?
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                           No. 
      Patrick Melrose - 'Never Mind' - Ep 2                               36
                                     DAVID2
                           That’s why you’re so pale. Well you 
                           must eat if you’re going to grow up 
                           strong. Go and see Yvette, she’ll 
                           find you something. Leave ELEANOR1 be 
                           today. All right? 
                DAVID2 places his hand on his son’s head, part papal 
                benediction, part threat, and heads past NICHOLAS2.

                           Dinner at eight. Don’t be late.
                A moment of eye contact between NICHOLAS2 and his PATRICK2, 
                NICHOLAS2, too,  knowing something is up, smiling uneasily.
                Music - luscious strings, the voice of Louis Armstrong -
        64      INT. ELEANOR’S BEDROOM, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 1967 - EVENING64
                ELEANOR’s musical taste leans towards show-tunes, Frank 
                Sinatra, big-band jazz. The stereo, however, is 1967’s 
                finest.
                But the timeless good taste of the house only occasionally 
                succumbs to the spirit of the times, and the LP is Louis 
                Armstrong, singing ‘I Only Have Eyes for You.’
                A glass of champagne in her hand, ELEANOR2 dances woozily -

                           know if it’s cloudy or bright...
                In the following, a sense of PREPARATION for a rite, nervous 
                anticipation, as MUSIC CONTINUES -

                           I thought it would turn you on! It 
                           did the first time. You were 
                           practically dribbling.

                As to your conversation.         Fuck off. Just fuck off, 
                ‘What a perfect life you have    NICHOLAS2 or I’ll elope with 
                here, what a wonderful           Barry!

                           So lie! There is such a thing as 
                           dishonesty, you know!

                about this, Puritanical.

                ELEANOR lines up her pills for the evening. A great many. 
                With champagne, she pops them one at a time. MUSIC CONTINUES-

                EVENING
                DAVID, in his dressing gown, slowly places his arm into the 
                steaming, scalding water.
                The skin is red, the pain excruciating. Every nerve orders 
                him to take his arm out, but he holds it, holds it - his face 
                full of contempt, rage, disgust. MUSIC CONTINUES -
        71      INT. ELEANOR’S BEDROOM, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 1967 - EVENING 71
                C.U. of the YOUNG PATRICK standing silently in the doorway, 
                watching his mother, in evening-wear now, sitting at her 
                desk, humming along -  
                She catches sight of PATRICK2, and jumps.  
                                     ELEANOR2
                           PATRICK2, don’t skulk! Either come 
                           into a room or leave! Sorry, 
                           darling, you made me jump, that’s 
                           all. 
                Impulsively, desperately, he tries to embrace her. ELEANOR2 
                hesitates, self-conscious about what to do next.

                           PATRICK2? What is it?
                A sudden panic. His eyes flicker about, looking for an exit -
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                               (his eyes flick to the

                           Can I take your glass down? Bring 
                           you another?
                A moment as ELEANOR2, distracted and confused, forgets the 
                question; the fog closing in again. She lets the moment go, 
                drains the glass - 
                                     ELEANOR2
                           What a thoughtful boy. I’m so 
                           pleased you’ve turned out well.
                               (a kiss)
                           I think the secret is not to 
                           interfere.
                And YOUNG PATRICK2 hurries out into the hall - 
        72      EXT. STAIRCASE, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 1967 - EVENING        72
                 - looking both ways. All clear. Out onto the landing and 
                down the stairs. 
                DAVID1 again.
                He freezes on the stairs and watches as DAVID1 passes above 
                without seeing him. He exhales - 
                Then looks at his hand. A drop of blood. The stem of the 
                champagne glass has snapped in his tightening fist. 
                Disaster! Panic setting in. He looks to the landing - DAVID1’s 
                voice, laughing with NICHOLAS1. Close-by -
                He looks at his hand. Blood dripping on the carpet. If his 
                father discovers he has broken it - 
                DAVID1’s voice again, as he returns to his room - 
                                     DAVID1
                           I’ll see you downstairs in an hour. 
                A decision. There are ten, twelve steps to the ground. 
                YOUNG PATRICK2 closes his eyes tight. Bunches his fists - 
                - he falls...

        73      INT. ELEANOR’S BEDROOM, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 1967 - EVENING73
                A SCREAM. ELEANOR sits, frozen, too numb and frightened to 
                follow her instincts, pinned to her chair as if by a javelin. 
        74      INT. DAVID’S BEDROOM, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 1967 - EVENING 74

                And now ELEANOR finally walks out onto the landing, to find 
                YVETTE cuddling YOUNG PATRICK, kissing him, calming him. From 
                ELEANOR’s POV - 
                                     YVETTE
                           Tu vas te casser la figure un de 
                           ces jours. Où est-ce que tu as mal, 
                           pauvre petit?
                And a look of terrible sadness crosses ELEANOR’s face. 
                                     ELEANOR2
                           Merci, Yvette. I’ll take over now. 
                And she comes and sits next to him, moving the fallen cowboy 
                hat. She winces and brushes glass off the step.
                                     ELEANOR2 (CONT’D)
                           Ouch. Poor mummy sat on some glass. 
                           Serves me right, no doubt. 
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                           It was an accident. Don’t tell 
                           father.
                                     ELEANOR2
                           I wouldn’t dream of it. Shall I 
                           tell you what I’ll do instead? 
                           We’ll go to L’OK Corral. Tomorrow, 
                           first thing, no excuses.  Would you 
                           like that? Just you and me? 
                And suddenly -
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                           I want to get away -

                           What on earth do you mean?

                           Leave here.

                           Yes. 
                But a TELEPHONE starts to ring, and now NICHOLAS2 and BRIDGET2 
                are on their way down too. An excuse for ELEANOR2.
                                     ELEANOR2 (CONT’D)
                           I really must get that.
                               (a kiss on the forehead)
                           I’ll be back to tuck you in, I 
                           promise.
                PATRICK watches her go, then resignedly goes back upstairs.
                NICHOLAS and BRIDGET come down still bickering. NICHOLAS 
                slightly rouged, BRIDGET in a Bohemian red velvet dress.
                                     NICHOLAS1
                           It looks like you bought it from a 
                           stall in Kensington Market. 
                                     BRIDGET1
                           I did buy it from a stall in 
                           Kensington Market.
                               (passing PATRICK1)
                           Hello again, strange little boy.
                                     NICHOLAS1
                           Well you look like a medieval 
                           witch. 
                                     BRIDGET1
                           And you look like an old fart, a 
                           stuffy, conventional old... 
                ELEANOR is waiting at the bottom of the stairs.
                                     ELEANOR1
                               (to BRIDGET1)
                           Telephone for you, um...
                                     BRIDGET1
                           Wow. How exciting! Who could it be!

                           Imagine wanting to talk to someone 
                           on the telephone. I dread it.

                           I dreaded it even more in my youth. 
                She looks for her son, but he has gone. Should she follow?

                           good as these people. In fact

                           should really be in a museum. 
                           Needless to say it’s David’s 
                           favourite.

                           I’m not so sure. He does like to 
                           have his own way.

                           Couldn’t you have got ANNE2 to iron 
                           that for you?

                BRIDGET is whispering on the phone, drawing hard on a joint, 
                unaware that DAVID is watching her; dressing gown over his 
                dinner suit but in the same yellow slippers.  
                                     BRIDGET
                           Christ, I wish I was with you 
                           instead... Why, what would you like 
                           me to do to you?
                Without changing his expression, we follow DAVID as he walks 
                on to the DRAWING ROOM where VICTOR is holding forth -

                           ...psychoanalysis will one day seem 
                           as quaint as medieval map-making, 
                           when we understand how the brain 
                           really works.

                           Nothing a don likes more than 
                           bashing another man’s discipline.

                           One can hardly call psychoanalysis 
                           a discipline.

                           But it helps people!

                           Victor, ANNE2, a pleasure to see 
                           you. ELEANOR2, I do like you in 
                           pink. It matches your eyes. Is that 
                           vodka I see?

                           Please don’t take this the wrong 
                           way but I find it hard to imagine 
                           you as a doctor.

                           So did I, my dear, and I must 
                           confess to stumbling a little over 
                           the Hippocratic Oath. Fortunately, 
                           ELEANOR2’s money removed the 
                           necessity of my living a useful 
                           life. Her great gift.
                He raises his glass to her, as does ELEANOR2 to him, and they 
                drink the vodka.

                           Hey, Dave. Love those kinky yellow 
                           slippers. 
                NICHOLAS2 winces, DAVID2 smiles. A smile like a knife.

                           Do you really like them? I’m so 
                           pleased. Vodka, my dear?

                           Victor, you sit there. No, no ANNE1, 
                           you sit next to... No, that’s not 
                           right...

                           Thank God we’re only six. While we 
                           wait for ELEANOR2 to solve the 
                           problem, ANNE1, tell me, what did 
                           you think of the Emperor Alba?

                           Anne was particularly taken with

                           Victor attempted to make me feel 
                           sorry for him.

                           BRIDGET2 - you sit here with me.

                           But Tiberius killed all of his 
                           family! It’s only natural that 
                           those who are terrified will become 
                           terrifying, given the opportunity. 
                                     ANNE2
                           Was that how it worked at Eton?
                                     VICTOR
                           Anne takes a rather satirical 
                           attitude to the English public 
                           school system - 
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           Does she now. 
                                     VICTOR
                           - but the compulsion to repeat what 
                           one has experienced is like 
                           gravity. It takes special equipment 
                           to break away. 
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           Careful, Victor. You sound like a 
                           psychoanalyst. 
                                     ANNE2
                           And as to the obsession with 
                           screwing his sisters -
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           Well you know what they say. Vice 
                           is nice, but incest is best. 
                               (ANNE2 rolls her eyes)
                           I’m sure I’d have liked the chap. 
                           He did exactly what he wanted to 
                           do. No nonsense about ethics.

                           Why do you think it’s superior to 
                           be amoral?

                           It’s not a question of being 
                           superior, it’s a question of not 
                           being a prig or a bore.

                           What one aims for is ennui.
                And soup is served.

                NIGHT
                Meanwhile, upstairs in his room, YOUNG PATRICK2 lies and 
                stares at the ceiling, breathing quickly, panic rising; all 
                the symptoms that we’ve seen in his older incarnation. 
                On the wall above him, the green GECKO. A memory this time.
                He closes his eyes, squeezing them tight -
        82      INT. DINING ROOM, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 1967 - NIGHT        82
                A joint of veal is wheeled into the dining room by YVETTE.
                                     DAVID2
                           ELEANOR2, what a marvellous memory 
                           you have, to be able to duplicate 
                           the dinner we had last time.
                               (ELEANOR2 stares into her 
                                glass, insensible)
                           Look at ELEANOR2! She has that 
                           expression she puts on when she is 
                           thinking of her dear rich dead 
                           mother. I’m right, aren’t I 
                           ELEANOR2?
                                     ELEANOR2
                           Yes, DAVID2.
                                     DAVID2
                               (telling a fairytale)
                           Once ELEANOR2’s dear father had been 
                           dismissed for being too drunk, she 
                           decided to purchase a Duke, a 
                           ‘real, old aristocrat’ on the 
                           grounds that if you’re going to buy 
                           a husband, he might as well be a 
                           Duke. And so the Duc de Valencay 
                           was re-upholstered with thick wads 
                           of dollars. But you just can’t 
                           treat human-beings like things!
                                     BRIDGET2
                           Definitely. 
      Patrick Melrose - 'Never Mind' - Ep 2                               48
                                     DAVID2
                           You agree with me?
                                     BRIDGET2
                           Definitely. 
                                     ANNE2
                           Maybe the human antiques wanted to 
                           be bought. 
                                     DAVID2
                           I’ve no doubt of that. I’m sure 
                           they were licking the windowpane. 
                           What so shocked Eleanor’s mother 
                           was that he dared to rear up on his 
                           Louis Quinze legs and start giving 
                           orders. 
                                     BRIDGET2
                           You see, I feel that so strongly. 
                           The problem with the world is 
                           people treating other people like 
                           things.
                                     DAVID2
                           I so agree. That’s something else 
                           we have in common. Things should be 
                           treated with great care.
                And DAVID2 takes BRIDGET2’s hand, rubbing her palm with his 
                thumb. 
                Too much for ANNE2. She stands noisily, excuses herself and 
                heads into the hall -

                - where she paces and smokes furiously, not wanting to go 
                back in. 
                                     ANNE2
                           ‘What one aims for is ennui!’ 
                She steps on something, bends down, picks it up. A shard of 
                glass. A voice - 
                YOUNG PATRICK2 sits on the bottom of the stairs
                                     ANNE2 (CONT’D)
                           Hello, PATRICK2. 
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                           I broke a glass. Don’t tell my 
                           DAVID1.
                His hand is crudely bandaged with a handkerchief.

                           You look so grim. What’s up? Can’t 
                           you get to sleep? Does it hurt? Let 
                           me see if it’s - 
                               (he recoils)
                           I only wanted to - 
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                           I’m fine.
                                     ANNE2
                           You’re shaking. What is it? D’you 
                           want to tell me? PATRICK2?

                As NICHOLAS2 goes into his act, DAVID2 looks to the hallway. 
                Who is that woman talking to?
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           ...I gather that Gerald Frogmore 
                           shot more birds last year than 
                           anyone in England. Not bad for a 
                           chap in a wheelchair.
                                     DAVID2
                           Perhaps he resents their freedom of 
                           movement.
        85      INT. HALLWAY, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 1967 - CONTINUOUS       85
                YOUNG PATRICK is still mute.
                                     ANNE2
                           What about ELEANOR1? Do you want 
                           to tell ELEANOR1?
                               (he nods)
                           I’ll go and get her. We’ll be back 
                           right away, I promise. 
                ANNE2 gets up and walks towards the dining room
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                           I don’t believe you.
                               (ANNE2 turns)
                           You say you will but you won’t. 
                                     ANNE2

                           Not since it ceased to be a public 
                           occasion. In the eighteenth 
                           century, a hanging was a good day’s 
                           outing. Everyone enjoyed 
                           themselves.

                           Even the man who was being hanged. 
                ANNE enters and discreetly approaches ELEANOR. DAVID watches.
                             DAVID                           ANNE
                   (listening in to ANNE)          (whispering to ELEANOR)
                Fun for all the family. God      I found Patrick on the 
                knows it’s what I aim for...     stairs. He wants to talk to 
                                                 you.
                ELEANOR rises unsteadily and goes with ANNE towards the door. 
                DAVID does not betray his anxiety, but it’s there.
                                     DAVID
                           Darling. ELEANOR2. I thought we 
                           agreed that you wouldn’t rush to 
                           PATRICK2 each time he whines and 
                           blubbers.
                                     ELEANOR2
                           But he fell down earlier. He may be 
                           hurt.
                                     DAVID2
                           In that case he may need a doctor.
                To ANNE and ELEANOR’s alarm, he stands - 
                                     ANNE2
                           He’s not hurt! He just wants to 
                           talk to ELEANOR2.
                                     DAVID2
                           You see, darling? He isn’t hurt and 
                           so it’s just a question of 
                           sentiment; does one allow oneself 
                           to be black-mailed or not?
                A terrible stalemate. DAVID2 sits.

                           If you sit, we can discuss it. 
                ELEANOR sits. Then, for the moment, ANNE2 sits, fuming.

                           The proposition I want to make is 
                           that education should be something 
                           of which a child can later say;

                           if I survived that, I can survive

                           That’s crazy and wrong and you know 
                           it!
                                     VICTOR
                           I certainly think a child should be 
                           challenged -
                                     ANNE2

                           No-one wants to make anyone 
                           miserable. We’re just saying -

                           We! Because God forbid you should

                           - that it doesn’t do a child any 
                           good to be molly-coddled. I know 
                           it’s an unfashionable view to hold, 
                           but in my opinion, nothing that 
                           happens to you as a child really 
                           matters.

                           When it comes to things that don’t 
                           matter, you’re top of my list.

                Saying silly things to sound     Oh, my word, a ferocious 
                less pompous and pompous         backhand from the young 
                things to sound less silly,      American lefty - 
                it’s pathetic!

                           Nothing that happened in your 
                           childhood did matter, NICHOLAS2. You 
                           just did what everyone expected.

                           Well I refuse to apologise for an 
                           uneventful childhood, or to relish 
                           the suffering at the expense of the 
                           happiness - big lawns, buckets and 
                           spades, throwing coins into the 
                           golden pool at the Ritz - 
      Patrick Melrose - 'Never Mind' - Ep 2                               52
                While the above is said, BRIDGET winces and looks down. 
                Beneath the table, something is touching her thigh. The 
                KNIFE, DAVID’s hand pressing it there. But DAVID is looking 
                forward, expressionless.
                                     BRIDGET2
                           What the fuck!
                                     DAVID2
                           Would you like a fig? They’re at 
                           their best this time of year. 
                He holds the fruit out to BRIDGET2. 
                                     DAVID2 (CONT’D)
                           I know how much you like them.
                A long moment. NICHOLAS2 caught in his betrayal.
                                     BRIDGET2
                           I’ll need a knife. 
                DAVID smiles. And ANNE stands. 
                                     ANNE2
                           I’m sorry, I’ve tried, but I can’t 
                           do this anymore.
                               (she stands. To NICHOLAS2)
                           You - you’re a pompous, silly 
                           little sycophant. And you -
                               (BRIDGET2)
                           - you should know better. 
                ELEANOR2, meanwhile, has retreated still further, and is 
                muttering to herself, practicing stock phrases. ‘Must you go? 
                Please don’t go’ DAVID2, impassive, unpacks a cigar.
                                     ANNE2 (CONT’D)
                           The only thing in your favour is 
                           that you frighten him - 
                               (-NICHOLAS2-)
                           That aside, you’re a failure. I’m 
                           sure you have all kinds of excuses 
                           and justifications for your 
                           mediocrity, but there’s nothing 
                           romantic or glamorous about it. 
                           It’s your son I feel sorry for, and 
                           if I had my way -
                               (DAVID2, immune. ‘What’s 
                                the point?’)
                           Victor, stay with your friends by 
                           all means but if you do then I 
                           never want -  
                                     VICTOR
                           No, no, I’ll come with you. Must 
                           get up early and finish my book.

                           ELEANOR2, PATRICK1 is in the hallway. 
                           He is sad and he is lonely and 
                           scared. I promised I’d bring you 
                           with me. Will you come and find out 
                           what has happened?
                A long moment. DAVID2 lights his cigar, nonchalant.
                                     ANNE2 (CONT’D)
                           Eleanor? Please?
                ELEANOR2 stands -
                                     DAVID2
                           ELEANOR2.
                And finds the words -
                                     ELEANOR2
                           Must you leave so soon?
                Then sits. DAVID2 has won.
                                     DAVID2
                           I hope you’ll forgive me if I don’t 
                           wave goodbye.
                ANNE2 walks out into the hall, VICTOR in tow - 
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           For someone so conventional, Victor 
                           does love an unconventional 
                           girlfriend.
                                     DAVID2
                           Almost nothing is as entertaining 
                           as the contortions of a clever 
                           Jewish snob.
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           Very broad-minded of you to have 
                           one in the house at all -
                And now BRIDGET2 has had enough. 
                                     BRIDGET2
                           Oh do fuck off, the pair of you.
                And she too stands and leaves.

                YOUNG PATRICK’s P.O.V, peering through the stair-rods as ANNE 
                takes VICTOR’s hand and whispers -

                                     ANNE2
                           Thank you. 
                                     VICTOR
                           No, you were right. In the end one 
                           must oppose cruelty, even if only 
                           by refusing to take part.
                                     ANNE2
                           Why are we whispering? 
                                     VICTOR
                           I have no idea!
                                     ANNE2
                               (leaving, remembering)
                           One moment. 
                ANNE turns and heads to the stairs. YOUNG PATRICK1 backs away 
                into the shadows.
                                     ANNE2 (CONT’D)
                           PATRICK1? PATRICK1, it’s only me!
                She walks up the stairs a little, peers into the darkness of 
                the landing. No sign of him. 
                                     ANNE2 (CONT’D)
                           He must have gone to bed. Oh well.
                But on the landing, YOUNG PATRICK2 watches...

                BRIDGET speaks in a low-voice on the phone, throwing her 
                clothes into a suitcase. 
                                     BRIDGET
                           One-thirty, outside the village 
                           church. Barry, you are saving my

                And tip-toes towards the terrace where, smoking cigars and 
                drinking brandy, DAVID1 listens as NICHOLAS1 entertains.
                                     DAVID1
                           I’m not familiar with the house of

                           They’re terribly Old Vicarage. 
                           Desperate to get Bridget into 
                           Country Life. Mother’s ‘keen on 
                           roses’, daddy likes the gee-gees. I 
                           took them to Covent Garden to see 
                           Le Nozze di Figaro, and when the 
                           conductor took to the podium, 
                           Rodney Watson-Scott said ‘They’re 
                           under starter’s orders...’ 
                DAVID laughs, BRIDGET curses and escapes unseen until she 
                sees the strangest sight - ELEANOR’s BUICK, all lit-up and 
                filled with smoke, blaring French pop music. 
        91      INT/EXT. BUICK, TERRACE, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 1967 - NIGHT91
                ELEANOR sits in her dressing-gown, drunk and high, smoking  
                Players and drinking cognac. 
                From ELEANOR’s POV, through the haze she sees BRIDGET 
                hobbling down the drive and away. She raises her hand in 
                farewell. ELEANOR waves back.  
        92      EXT. CHURCH, LACOSTE 1967 - NIGHT                          92
                And now the clock strikes two, and BRIDGET stands shivering 
                in her mini-skirt. Headlights - a car. Hope! But it drives 
                on.
                                     BRIDGET
                           Oh, Barry. 
                No use. He’s not coming. She starts to walk down the hill. 
        93      INT/EXT. BUICK, TERRACE, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 1967 - NIGHT93
                ELEANOR’s private party in the smoky car continues as BRIDGET 
                returns, hobbling on blistered feet with a defeated air.
                ELEANOR winds down the window - 
                                     ELEANOR2
                           You see? It’s not as easy as you 
                           think!
                And BRIDGET2 hobbles back to the house. A track comes on the 
                car radio. Jagged, minor key; Season of the Witch perhaps, 
                the Julie Driscoll cover version. ELEANOR2 turns up the 
                volume, slowly reclines the seat, cigarette still burning in 
                her hand.

                The worst of the withdrawal has passed, and he lies in 
                tangled sheets, sweat on his brow. 
                JOHNNY sleeps in an armchair. Someone enters the room, a 
                FEMALE FIGURE. She crosses to PATRICK, feels his brow with 
                the back of her hand. JOHNNY wakes.

                           No, me neither. Must be all the

                           I’ll leave you now. But know one

                           ELEANOR1, or anyone else, about

        1A      EXT. ENNISMORE GARDENS, LONDON 1990 - DAWN                 1A
                PATRICK’s West London flat. 
        2       INT. BEDROOM, ENNISMORE GARDENS, LONDON 1990 - DAWN         2
                PATRICK MELROSE lies awake towards the end of another 
                sleepless night. On his bedside table -
                - the green lizard, the GECKO. Tongue flicking, it squats on 
                the pile of books by his bedside, and PATRICK watches it 
                quite calmly before -
                - sitting, rousing himself, blinking the hallucination away. 
                In his thirties now, PATRICK is healthier, less chaotic and 
                self-destructive but pale, ill-at-ease as if newly released 
                from prison (or a psychiatric ward, or rehab, as is the 
                case). You’d be hard-pressed to say that sobriety has brought 
                health and happiness. By the bedside - anti-depressants and 
                sleeping pills. PROZAC perhaps.
                He dresses. Routine. 
        3       INT. HALLWAY, ENNISMORE GARDENS, LONDON 1990 - DAWN         3
                In the hallway, mail on the doorstep. He picks it up, adds it 
                to the thick pile of unopened envelopes.

                The kettle boils. PATRICK watches, head resting against the 
                cupboard. He pours water on the tea bag, adds one, two, three 
                teaspoonfuls of sugar. Too much? He taps some back -
                - and spills some granules on the work-top. He crushes the 
                grains with the back of his teaspoon then, using the edge of 
                it, he crunches the powdered sugar into A NEAT LINE.
                A moment. 
                Then he brushes the crystalline white powder into his hand 
                and tosses it into the sink. MUSIC CONTINUES -

                C.U. - books, legal textbooks, thick and dull - ‘Street on 
                Tort’, ‘Charlesworth on Negligence’, ‘The Concept of 
                Justice’.
                But PATRICK is laying on the sofa, watching day-time TV. 
                Videos scatter the floor. The sun is shining on the screen. 
                He stands and draws the curtains. Sits. Surveys the room - 
                the mess, the claustrophobia. A spasm of self-loathing at the 
                drabness of it all. 
                The sound of a door bell. He freezes. The bell sounds again. 
                Genuine alarm from PATRICK -
                                     PATRICK

        7       EXT/INT. CHEATLEY, THE COTSWOLDS 1990 - MORNING             7
                And now here is CHEATLEY, the fine stately home of Lord and 
                Lady Gravesend. A sweeping drive, an ornamental lake in the 
                misty light. 
                Framed by a window, BRIDGET WATSON-SCOTT, NICHOLAS PRATT’s 
                Chelsea girlfriend in ‘Never Mind’
                But now she is Lady Gravesend, early-forties, surveying the 
                view with dissatisfaction. She wears her dressing-gown, tea 
                in one hand, cigarette in the other. She seems pinched, 
                tense, the clear blue-eyes clouded over as she glowers 
                unhappily at the makeshift marquee that now mars the rear 
                vista.

                SONNY1 GRAVESEND - fifty, foolish and complacent - lies in bed 
                with breakfast and the newspapers.
                                     SONNY2
                           Darling, what’s all this in 
                           Dempster this morning? ‘Two hundred 
                           guests, ten thousand acres, party 
                           of the year’. It sounds as if we’re 
                           made of money! I told you not to 
                           talk to the press!
                                     BRIDGET2
                           I didn’t talk to the press!
                                     SONNY2
                           ‘”I’m just having a few friends 
                           round to celebrate my husband’s 
                           birthday” says Lady BRIDGET2. 
                           Guests include Princess Margaret -’

                           Frankly I wish I hadn’t bothered. 
                           It’s so grey out there! If it was 
                           May or June, we could be out on the 
                           big lawn, but in November -

                           One can’t choose when one’s born -
                                     BRIDGET2
                           No. It’s extremely aggravating. 
                           I’ve asked Tony to come early and
                           brighten it up -

                           That appalling little man shouldn’t 
                           be coming at all.

                SONNY2 collapses back onto the pillows and, when the coast is 
                clear, picks up the phone - a chunky wireless model. He 
                dials. 
                                     SONNY

        12      INT. HALLWAY, ENNISMORE GARDENS, LONDON 1990 - MORNING     12
                The doorbell rings persistently. The door is on a chain.  
                PATRICK opens it a little -
                                     PATRICK2
                           Hello?
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           Why haven’t you replied to BRIDGET2?
                           You simply must come. Open this 
                           door!
                No way out. PATRICK2 opens the door, and NICHOLAS2 rushes in -
        13      INT. LIVING ROOM, ENNISMORE GARDENS, LONDON 1990 - CONTINUOUS13
                NICHOLAS flicks through the unopened mail as PATRICK tries to 
                make it respectable. 
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           Do you have any idea how hard it 
                           was to get you invited in the first 
                           place?
                                     PATRICK2
                           I’m very grateful, but I don’t feel 
                           ready for the world just yet.

                                bustles next door)
                           Why are these curtains drawn? 
                               (he pulls them open and 
                                inspects the room)
                           Better than a psychiatric ward, I 
                           suppose. Theoretically. I need a 
                           drink. Do you have a drink, a 
                           proper drink?
                                     PATRICK2
                           That’s what put me in the ward. I 
                           can offer you herbal tea.
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           Don’t be absurd. You might at least 
                           open a window, or step outside once 
                           in a while. And ELEANOR1, too, 
                           she’s almost as reclusive as you 
                           are.
                                     PATRICK2
                           It’s amazing, isn’t it? She seems 
                           to think there are better things to 
                           do than go to parties.
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           Yes, I always thought she was a 
                           little peculiar. Where is ELEANOR1? 
                                     PATRICK2
                           As far as I know she’s driving a 
                           consignment of ten thousand 
                           syringes to Poland. People say it’s 
                           marvellous of her, but I still 
                           think charity begins at home. I 
                           wish she’d bring them round here.
                A moment, then NICHOLAS2 sighs. More serious now.
                                     NICHOLAS
                           I thought all that was behind you. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           Behind me, in front of me, who 
                           knows? 
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           You’re being very melodramatic 
                           today.
                                     PATRICK2
                           Well, I’ve realised that I’ve given 
                           up everything and taken up nothing.

                                     NICHOLAS2
                               (the law books)
                           I thought you were going to ‘work 
                           for a living’?
                                     PATRICK2
                           That’s the intention. In fact, it’s 
                           a necessity after the medical 
                           bills. But I still feel rather as 
                           if life - 
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           That’s enough. Sit down, please.
                               (taken aback, PATRICK2 does 
                                so)
                           Offended as I am by the very idea 
                           of a ‘pep talk’ I’m left with no 
                           choice. You can’t rot in this 
                           hovel. Quite apart from how 
                           depressing it all is, I owe it to 
                           your dear papa to get you back in 
                           the swim of things -
                                     PATRICK2
                           The worry is, NICHOLAS2, that I 
                           might drown -
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           Nonsense. Pull yourself together, 
                           find something to wear, and if you 
                           must talk about ‘life’, you can do 
                           so at the party. I’m sure someone 
                           will listen to you.
                               (leaving)
                           I’ll reply to BRIDGET2 on your 
                           behalf. 
                               (handing over the invite)
                           And remember, it’s a party, you’re 
                           not meant to enjoy it.

                BRIDGET2 certainly isn’t enjoying it as she stands and frets 
                amidst FLOWER ARRANGERS, CATERERS, TECHNICIANS, all bustling 
                around the huge space.
                TONY FOWLES, trusted friend, is taking control.

                           Now, I know what you’re thinking, 
                           not enough colour. Which is why 
                           I’ve bought you these -

                                large boxes)
                           I thought tents, I thought poles, I 
                           thought ribbons, I thought maypoles

                                     BRIDGET2
                           I see. Sorry, what’s the dreaded? 
                                     TONY FOWLES
                               (mouthing)
                           V.A.T.

                           Goodness. 
                A little way off, a small GIRL, BELINDA, 7, is being shouted 
                at by a ferocious Scottish NANNY.
                             NANNY                     BRIDGET2 (CONT'D)
                You’re a naughty, naughty        Oh, dear. I do wish Nanny 
                girl! Running out here,          wasn’t quite so horrid to 
                without a coat. You’re a         Belinda.
                nuisance to me and a burden 
                to your parents.
                                     TONY FOWLES
                           Well, why don’t you just sack the 
                           old hag? 
                                     BRIDGET2
                           She’s terrifying. Tony, just...make 
                           it better, will you?
                And BRIDGET crosses to NANNY and her DAUGHTER. NANNY 
                brandishes a walkie-talkie in BELINDA’s face.
                                     NANNY
                           Where did you get this? Tell me! 
                           Where? Did you steal it? Did you?
                                     BRIDGET2
                           I’m sure she didn’t steal it, 
                           Nanny. One of the security men will 
                           have lost it. Here - 
                               (the walkie-talkie)
                           I’ll find who it belongs to.
                                     BELINDA
                           And mummy, will you come and play?

                           Your mother is much, much too busy 
                           to play with the likes of you!
                                     BRIDGET2
                           Maybe later, darling. 
                And she walks on towards the house, pressing buttons on the 
                walkie-talkie...
                                     BRIDGET2 (CONT’D)
                           Hello? Can anyone hear me? I have 
                           your walkie...
                A click, a buzz, feedback, then through the static, Sonny’s 
                voice - 
                                     SONNY1 (O.C.)
                           Of course I’ll tell her! But it can 
                           hardly be tonight after all the 
                           work BRIDGET2’s put in...
                The sound fades into static. Frantic, BRIDGET2 shakes the 
                walkie-talkie, turns dials, the voice comes back -
                                     SONNY1 (CONT’D)
                           Let’s not think about that now, my 
                           love...
                Confused, dazed, she looks up at the beautiful house. In the 
                bedroom, SONNY1 is on the wireless phone, his back to the 
                window.

                           see you in the flesh, even if it’s 
                           just a glimpse.
        16      EXT. GROUNDS, CHEATLEY, THE COTSWOLDS 1990 - CONTINUOUS    16
                Click, buzz, the voices have gone. BRIDGET stands, dumb-
                founded as around her caterers, florists, musicians, security 
                guards and bartenders prepare for the party of the decade. 
                Her hand hangs loosely by her side.
                A world starting to crumble.
                The sound of a phone ringing -

        17      INT. JOHNNY2 HALL’S FLAT, NOTTING HILL, LONDON 1990 - MORNING17
                JOHNNY HALL, too, is clean now, though he seems to be a 
                little better at it than PATRICK1. As the phone rings on, he’s 
                in bed with JULIA2, PATRICK1’s secret girlfriend from ‘Bad 
                News’, now JULIA2 BROGILE. 
                                     JULIA2
                           Who is that d’you think?
                               (ringing continues)
                           Aren’t you going to answer?
                                     JOHNNY2
                               (the answering machine 
                                clicks on)
                           Not this second -
                PATRICK1 sounds manic.
                                     PATRICK1 (O.S.)
                           This party tonight, BRIDGET1’s 
                           party, I need you to come as my 
                           guest. I’m ready to leave the 
                           house. Am I ready? Almost certainly 
                           not -

                           PATRICK1! Go and answer!
                He sighs, pads towards the phone as PATRICK1 rattles on - 
                                     PATRICK1 (O.S.)
                           Debbie will be there, Christ,

                           should apologise to and can’t, at 
                           least not without drugs, which is 
                           the very thing I need to apologise 
                           for, and JULIA2, God, JULIA2! -

                PATRICK1 is emptying out his wardrobe, searching its depths

                               (moving outside)
                           Well I hate to agree with NICHOLAS1 
                           Pratt, but perhaps he’s right.
                                     PATRICK2
                           I’ll need your help. Can you drive 
                           me down? 
                                     JOHNNY2
                           Of course, but I have to go to my 
                           meeting first. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           What meeting? Oh, that meeting. I 
                           don’t know how you put up with 
                           those things. Aren’t they full of 
                           ghastly people?

                           Isn’t any crowded room? 
                                     PATRICK2
                           Which is why I mustn’t go to this 
                           party!
                                     JOHNNY2
                           Three o’clock. I’ll see you there. 
                           It’s open to everyone, by the way.
                And JOHNNY2 hangs up. JULIA2 waits, a little too expectantly.
                                     JULIA2
                           PATRICK1 Melrose. He’ll be fun.

                           I wouldn’t count on it. 
                                     JULIA2
                           Have you told him about us?

                           No, you told me not to. Have you?

                           I haven’t seen PATRICK1 for ages. 
                           Did he ask about me?

                           He said he’s very much looking 
                           forward to meeting your husband. So

                Weekend bag packed, PATRICK2 stands ready to leave the house. 
                But there’s still something of the agoraphobic’s anxiety to 
                the act. He puts on sunglasses, for protection.

                BRIDGET2 too. Hands shaking, she takes a Valium and washes it 
                down with a glass of champagne.

                A minicab stops on the imposing gravel driveway of Cheatley; 
                VIRGINIA2 WATSON-SCOTT, 65, BRIDGET1’s mother, in her best 
                dress and coat but still out of place. Flustered, she pokes 
                around in her purse.

                           busy day like this!
                                     SONNY2
                           So - what are we reading?
                                     BELINDA

                           This one.
                BRIDGET2, stunned and numb, watches from the doorway.
                                     SONNY2
                           But you’ve just read it. Why would 
                           you want to hear it again?
                                     BELINDA
                           Please, Dada, it’s my favourite. 
                                     SONNY2
                           Very well. ‘For many generations, 
                           families of mice have made their

                Instant coffee is spooned into plastic cups and a great urn 
                of tea is rolled into place. A rundown community centre. 
                There’s lots of chatter, laughter, embracing, a convivial 
                atmosphere even if JOHNNY2 is a little self-conscious and 
                disconnected, taking a seat at the back of the circle of 
                chairs. The Secretary, HARRY -

                PATRICK2 carries a small overnight bag, his suit on a hanger, 
                bundled to his chest. The meeting has overrun, and he’s 
                striding impatiently towards the room.

                           Someone told me recovery was about 
                           learning to put your tie round your 
                           neck instead of your arm. That’s 
                           easy, I thought, I can do that...

                - we follow PATRICK2 as he approaches the meeting room.
                In the room, PETER is skinny, wired, as nervous as PATRICK2, 
                who sits now.

                           ...but when I was using, I found it 
                           easy to cross the road because I 
                           genuinely didn’t care if I was run 
                           over or not. Now I’m in recovery 
                           I’m fucking terrified. I walk for 
                           miles for a zebra crossing - 
                               (PATRICK2 sits forward)
                           Just this morning I found myself 
                           chopping out lines of Colman’s 
                           Mustard Powder. Little neat lines.
                               (Laughter. Recognition

                           I make tea, and I find myself 
                           worrying that I’ve put too much 
                           sugar in the spoon, I watch TV and 
                           I start to think I’m controlling 
                           it. I couldn’t watch it last night 
                           ‘cos I was worried I was putting 
                           the weatherman off by staring at 
                           him. So sometimes I think, fuck it, 
                           what’s the point, just start using 
                           again, what’s to stop you? Is 
                           saying this out loud meant to help 
                           somehow? Am I meant to feel better 
                           now? I don’t know. Anyway. Thanks.

                           spoken yet?
                JOHNNY2 hesitates - he hasn’t seen PATRICK2 and so is free from

                           My name’s JOHNNY2 and I am an

                           Hi Johnny!
                                     JOHNNY2
                           I’m going to a party with a good 
                           friend tonight, also in recovery,  
                           not in NA, and I know there’ll be 
                           lots of drugs around, alcohol 
                           too... 
                PATRICK2 has sunk in the chair, touched by JOHNNY2’s sincerity. 
                From AMANDA, at the front - 
                                     AMANDA
                           I’m going too! Hi Johnny!
                                     JOHNNY2
                           Anyway, it’s a big party and I just 
                           feel under threat I suppose. So I 
                           just wanted to reaffirm my desire 
                           to stay clean today, and hopefully 
                           keep my friend clean too. Thanks. 
                                     GROUP
                           Thanks, Johnny. 
                And JOHNNY2 sits down, relieved. 
                At the back of the room, PATRICK2 takes this in, his cynicism 
                suppressed, for now at least. 
                                     HARRY
                           Thanks, Johnny. Now before we 
                           finish it’s newcomer time, 
                           newcomers only, please. Anyone?
                JOHNNY2 looks around the room and sees PATRICK2 for the first 
                time. 
                PATRICK2 snaps into his impervious manner, shrugs, taps his 
                watch. JOHNNY2 turns back, smiles -

                AFTERNOON
                JOHNNY2 and AMANDA are stacking chairs.
                                     AMANDA
                           I knew you were talking about 
                           Cheatley! Is it true that PATRICK1 
                           Melrose is coming? Because I’m not 
                           sure it’s good for people like us 
                           to be around that kind of 
                           negativity - 
                                     JOHNNY2
                           And here he is!
                                     AMANDA
                           Hello, PATRICK2! Nice to see you out 
                           and about.
                                     JOHNNY2
                           Amanda was just wondering if you 
                           were coming to the party.
                                     PATRICK2
                           You know I think I might!
                                     AMANDA
                           Great! I’ll see you there! I may 
                           need you for an emergency meeting!
                                     JOHNNY2
                           I’ll feel safer knowing you’re 
                           there.
                She leaves. PATRICK2 narrows his eyes.
                                     PATRICK2
                           She’s not an addict, she just likes 
                           a bit of coke. Amateur!
                               (while JOHNNY2 stacks 
                                chairs)
                           Honestly, I don’t know how you 
                           stand it. The slogans, all that 
                           fatuous jargon - 
                                     JOHNNY2
                           That’s not a reason to hope they 
                           fail.

                                     PATRICK2
                           I don’t hope they fail! I just 
                           don’t know how anyone can bear the 
                           hypocrisy. 
                                     JOHNNY2
                           They have a slogan for that too. 
                           ‘Fake it to make it.’
                                     PATRICK2
                           Christ, it’s worse than I thought.
                                     JOHNNY2
                           It’s just a place to confess.
                                     PATRICK2
                           Fine, if you confess the thing that 
                           matters and people never do. 
                                     JOHNNY2
                           Even so, if it helps to say these 
                           things out loud - 
                                     PATRICK2
                           But it’s so unnecessary!
                                     JOHNNY2
                           Why? Don’t you find it hard not to 
                           take drugs?
                                     PATRICK2
                           Of course, it’s a fucking 
                           nightmare, being lucid.

                           My inner-life, JOHNNY2, is an 
                           endless reel of decapitations and 
                           dogs fighting over the liver I 
                           quite want back thank you very 
                           much. Oblivion would be wonderful, 
                           if I didn’t have this horror of 
                           forgetting.

                Two hours to go. VIRGINIA2 and BELINDA are playing happily as 
                BRIDGET2 and TONY return, dressed now for the evening.
                                     BELINDA
                               (a bag of sweets)
                           Look what VIRGINIA2 bought me! Would 
                           you like one?
                                     BRIDGET2
                           You mustn’t give her sweets. 
                           They’re very bad for her teeth.
                           VIRGINIA2 disapproves terribly, don’t 
                           you, Nanny?

                           Perhaps she could just have one or 
                           two after dinner.

                           it’d be nicer, more relaxed, at 
                           their dinner table. Then you can 
                           come later to the big party, the

                           you excuse me, I must just -
                And she heads out, tugging the paper tissue from her cardigan 
                sleeve, struggling to hide her hurt.

                           What on earth makes you say that?

                A flowered duvet on twin beds too close together, a chintzy 
                cell. PATRICK, half-dressed, boils the kettle, spoons sugar 
                into the cup. Too much in the spoon?
                He picks up the Hotel brochure - a lurid picture of a 
                bleeding rib of beef. ‘Dine in our famous Cotswold 
                Carvery...’

                           disappointment.’ Hm.
                He channel-hops, quick flashes, perhaps a moment of ‘Zulu’. 
                The inanities of local news, the TV WEATHERMAN talking 
                straight at him. PATRICK2 glares back at the TV. He wonders -

                           We’ve had a fairly bright pleasant 
                           afternoon, 4 or 5 degrees, but as 
                           night falls so will those 
                           temperatures. Nothing unusual for 
                           this time of year, and it’s going 
                           to be a dry night but with 
                           temperatures of one or two degrees 
                           in central regions. Tomorrow, we’re 
                           looking at mist and fog but still 
                           no rain, at least not until the 
                           weekend and then we really will see 
                           a change...
                PART 3 PATRICK2’S HOTEL ROOM 
                He snaps off the TV, hurls himself back onto the bed. The 
                Gecko here perhaps? But memories of the past, other hotel 
                rooms -  
                                     DAVID2 (V.O.)
                           Good God, what an appalling dump. 
                           You see what I’m reduced to?
        35      INT. HOTEL ROOM, PROVENCE 1968 - DAY                       35
                Mediterranean light. Twin beds too close together. DAVID2 
                MELROSE inspects the hotel room. This is shortly after his 
                divorce - no beard yet, but a redness to the eyes, stubble - 
                the beginning of the decline. 
                                     DAVID2
                           Your mother will be delighted. I 
                           can see her gloating, when you 
                           report back. 
      Patrick Melrose - 'Some Hope' - Ep3                                 21
                YOUNG PATRICK2 is behind him with the suitcases, nervous, 
                sweating, his TEN YEAR-OLD SELF.
                                     DAVID2 (CONT’D)
                           Do you report back?
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                               (he shakes his head)
                           Perhaps we could find somewhere 
                           else. Perhaps we could - 
                                     DAVID2
                           No, but we must live within our 
                           means! This will do. Now - 
                               (the beds)
                           -left or right? 
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                           Don’t mind. 
                DAVID2 sits wearily, and removes his shoes. 
                YOUNG PATRICK2 is shaking, terrified, doing all he can not to 
                run from the room. 
                                     DAVID2
                           I’m a very tired man. Come and talk 
                           to me, PATRICK2. 
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                           I have to -
                                     DAVID2
                           PATRICK2. Come and talk to your dear 
                           old dad. Please.
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                           I’m going to the bathroom.
                A moment. Then - 
                                     DAVID2
                           Well. Don’t be long.
                The bathroom door closes on DAVID2.
        36      INT. HOTEL BATHROOM, THE CAMARGUE, PROVENCE 1968 - DAY     36
                YOUNG PATRICK2 paces, tearful, fists clenching and 
                unclenching, muttering to himself. 
                                     DAVID2 (O.S.)
                           PATRICK2? PATRICK2, where are you?
                           PATRICK2!
      Patrick Melrose - 'Some Hope' - Ep3                                 22
                There’s no escape, no alternative. Hand trembling, YOUNG 
                PATRICK2 opens the door. DAVID2 waits on the bed - 
                                                             HARD CUT TO -
        37      INT. HOTEL ROOM, LITTLE SODDINGTON HOTEL 1990 - EVENING    37
                The same fear - panicked breathing. PATRICK2 grabs the bedside 
                phone. Affecting calm -
                                     PATRICK2
                           JOHNNY1, can we get out of here? As 
                           soon as possible.

        39      EXT. DRIVE, CHEATLEY, THE COTSWOLDS 1990 - NIGHT           39
                And here is SONNY2, shifty, checking his watch, waiting 
                nervously. 
                Flaming torches light the driveway as BRIDGET hurries her 
                mother into a battered local mini-cab. VIRGINIA peers into 
                her purse.
                                     BRIDGET2
                           We’ll let you know when it’s time 
                           to come back. Not too early!
                                     VIRGINIA2
                           Righty-o!
                                     BRIDGET2
                           Please don’t say ‘righty-o’.
                                     VIRGINIA2
                           Sorry. Must have caught it off your 
                           father!
                                     BRIDGET2
                           Now do you have some money?
                                     VIRGINIA2
                           I think so. The cab from the 
                           station was more expensive than 
                           I...
                But the royal car is approaching. Panic.
                                     BRIDGET2
                           Here comes the Princess! For 
                           goodness sake, I’ll pay you back 
                           later! Go! Drive, drive!
                And she waves the minicab off. SONNY2 arrives.

                                     BRIDGET2 (CONT’D)
                           Now remember. Don’t fawn.
                                     SONNY22
                           Righty-o.
                                     BRIDGET2
                           Christ, not you too. 
                PATRICK2 and JOHNNY2 are walking up the drive, taking in the 
                flaming torches, the liveried WAITERS, the splendour of it 
                all -
                                     PATRICK2
                           Bloody hell, BRIDGET1. 
                                     JOHNNY2
                           Only the best for SONNY1.
                They arrive just as PRINCESS MARGARET is stepping from her 
                car. Along with one LADY-IN-WAITING, luggage, one SECURITY 
                MAN. BRIDGET1 curtsies - all from PATRICK1 and JOHNNY1’s POV.
                                     PATRICK2
                           Stay close. Don’t go too far away.
                                     JOHNNY2
                           I won’t. Hold your nerve. It’s 
                           going to be fine.
        40      INT. RECEPTION ROOM, CHEATLEY, THE COTSWOLDS 1990 - NIGHT 40
                In a grand, high-ceilinged Reception Room, SONNY1 and his 
                inner-circle are awaiting the Princess’s arrival. There are 
                twenty or so guests for drinks and dinner. NICHOLAS2 PRATT 
                stands with JACQUES and JACQUELINE D’ALANTOUR, the French 
                Ambassador and his wife. 
                                     JACQUELINE
                           So this old flame of yours, BRIDGET1 
                           Gravesend, she is bien née?
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           Not at all. Father was very used-
                           car-salesman, mother pure Surrey 
                           Pines.
                                     JACQUES
                           ‘Not quite from the top basket’ as 
                           you say.
                                     JACQUELINE
                           And is that why you didn’t marry 
                           her?
      Patrick Melrose - 'Some Hope' - Ep3                                 24
                                     NICHOLAS
                           Pas du tout. I’m quite bien né 
                           enough for two. No, I’m happy to 
                           associate with everyone, from the 
                           monarch to the humblest baronet in 
                           the land.
                                     JACQUELINE
                           But there are so many varieties of 
                           snobbery. Some, like not having 
                           pigs at one’s table, are simply 
                           common sense..
                                     JACQUES
                           And yet, as ambassador, it is 
                           sometimes necessary to have pigs at 
                           one’s table.
                                     JACQUELINE
                           If they are at one’s table, they 
                           are no longer pigs. 
                While the three of them enjoy the wisdom of this remark, 
                NICHOLAS spots PATRICK and raises his glass.
                                     PATRICK2
                           All the old faces. I wouldn’t be 
                           surprised if my fucking DAVID1 
                           leapt out from behind a pillar. 
                           ‘Supri-ise!’

                           No, thank you.
                                     PATRICK2
                           Years since I spoke to a stranger 
                           without drugs -
                                     JOHNNY2
                           Even when we did take drugs, all we 
                           ever saw was the inside of loos.
                                     PATRICK2
                           Yes, nowadays when I go to the loo, 
                           I say to myself, what are you doing 
                           here? You don’t take drugs anymore. 
                           It’s only after I’ve stormed out 
                           that I remember I need a piss -

                           I suppose ‘the young’ will be 
                           taking ecstasy this evening.

                                     PATRICK2
                           Call me old-fashioned, but I don’t 
                           like the sound of a non-addictive 
                           drug. If it’s not going to fuck you 
                           up, what’s the point? 
                               (as a WAITER passes)

                           No, thank you.
                                     JOHNNY2
                           I feel a bit stupid, saying this to 
                           you, but..if you did want to talk -

                               (- then regretfully)
                           Yes. Of course. I’m sorry.

                           I kept hearing that you’d died. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           Just once or twice. BRIDGET2, you 
                           look lovely. 
                                     JOHNNY2
                           It’s true, you do.
                                     BRIDGET2
                           Thank you, both.
                               (adjusting PATRICK2’s tie)
                           I’ve put you with someone who’ll 
                           keep an eye on you. My cousin, 
                           MARY2. 
                A WOMAN in evening dress. MARY2, late-20s, wise, calm, 
                watchful - we’ll see more of her. 
                                     BRIDGET2 (CONT’D)
                           Ah, here she is! 
                PRINCESS MARGARET enters and all eyes turn - our first proper 
                look. There’s not a fanfare exactly, silence instead as SONNY 
                and BRIDGET rush to her side.
      Patrick Melrose - 'Some Hope' - Ep3                                 26
                                     BRIDGET2 (CONT’D)
                           Remember, don’t sit down until P.M. 
                           sits down!
                As all heads turn to P.M., PATRICK2 catches MARY2’s eye. 
                Conspicuously not applauding. She smiles back.
        41      INT. DINING ROOM, CHEATLEY, THE COTSWOLDS 1990 - NIGHT     41
                The high double doors swing open, and PRINCESS MARGARET and 
                SONNY head into the dining room. It looks sumptuous, but P.M. 
                has seen many, many rooms like this. 
                                     TONY FOWLES
                           Of course I love the countryside, 
                           but I do wish everything would stay 
                           still. I’m so aesthetic, I want to 
                           arrange the cows and glue them to 
                           the spot.
                                     PRINCESS MARGARET
                           Tony, you are funny!
                                     SONNY2
                               (watching this)
                           What’s he doing here anyway? Bloody 
                           Rasputin - 
                                     BRIDGET2
                           You’re ridiculous, a ridiculous 
                           snob.
                                     SONNY2
                               (separating P.M. and TONY)
                           Ma’am, if I could just - 
                                     PRINCESS MARGARET
                           Oh. Why? Where am I sitting?
                                     SONNY2
                           Next to the French Ambassador, 
                           ma’am.
                PRINCESS MARGARET’s disappointment is palpable.
                                     JACQUES
                           I think it was Marcel Proust who 
                           said that the number of guests at 
                           dinner should be more than the 
                           graces and less than the muses, but 
                           this is something absolutely 
                           extraordinary.
                                     PRINCESS MARGARET
                           I don’t know what you’re talking 
                           about. Shall we get started?
      Patrick Melrose - 'Some Hope' - Ep3                                 27
                Everyone stands ready. PATRICK2, distracted, sits, notes his 
                error, stands. The PRINCESS sits, which means the rest of the 
                guests can sit too.
        42      INT. DINING ROOM, CHEATLEY, THE COTSWOLDS 1990 - NIGHT     42
                Dinner is now underway, and the seating plan is as below;
                JACQUELINE - - TONY, BRIDGET2, JACQUES, MARGA., SONNY2 - JOHNNY2 
                - - - - MARY2, PATRICK2, NICHOLAS2 -- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
                Seated in the centre, P.M. is holding forth.
                                     PRINCESS MARGARET
                           - my lady-in-waiting leant over to 
                           the taxi driver and said ‘take us 
                           to the Royal Garden Hotel’ which, 
                           as you know, is at the bottom of 
                           the drive, and the taxi driver 
                           nodded at me and said -  
                               (sort-of Cockney accent)
                           ‘I know were she lives!’
                                     SONNY2
                               (laughing extravagantly)
                           What a wonderful story! What 
                           wonderful people! Salt of the 
                           earth!
                Meanwhile, the WAITER goes to pour white wine. PATRICK2 
                declines. He is intensely uncomfortable, fidgety, ill-at-
                ease. MARY2 notes all of this and makes an attempt at casual 
                conversation.
                                     MARY2
                           I saw you earlier.
                                     PATRICK2
                           Hm?
                                     MARY2
                           In reception. We’re staying at the 
                           same hotel. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           Ah! Home of the famous Cotswold 
                           Carvery. 
                                     MARY2
                           ‘Book early to avoid 
                           disappointment’.
                                     PATRICK2
                           If only I’d known it was so easy. 
                           To avoid disappointment, I mean.
      Patrick Melrose - 'Some Hope' - Ep3                                 28
                                     MARY2
                           Would you rather be there than 
                           here?
                                     PATRICK2
                           Almost anywhere. And yet if I 
                           wasn’t here, it’s the only place 
                           I’d want to be.
                                     MARY2
                           So how do you manage?
                                     PATRICK2
                           Hm?
                                     MARY2
                           To avoid disappointment? 
                PATRICK2 is surprised to be almost enjoying himself now.
                                     PATRICK2
                           It’s impossible. Salvation crumbles 
                           as soon as you touch it. I mean 
                           look at everyone - snobs, social 
                           climbers, museum pieces. 
                                     MARY2
                           I must say, I’m not quite sure why 
                           I’m here either. I think BRIDGET1 
                           likes the family to know she’s 
                           arrived.
                On BRIDGET1, unhappy, as P.M. talks to SONNY2.
                                     PATRICK2
                           I’m sure. But arrived where?
                Over to PRINCESS MARGARET.
                                     PRINCESS MARGARET
                               (Examining her fork -)
                           What is this? Venison? It’s hard to 
                           tell in this murky sauce.
                                     SONNY2
                           Yes, it is venison. I’m awfully 
                           sorry about the sauce. It’s 
                           perfectly disgusting. 
                                     PRINCESS MARGARET
                               (turning to D’ALANTOUR)
                           Do you like it? It’s venison.
                                     JACQUES
                           Really, it is something absolutely 
                           marvellous. The sauce is so subtle. 
                           I did not know one could find such 
                           cooking in this country...
      Patrick Melrose - 'Some Hope' - Ep3                                 29
                And in his enthusiasm, a gobbet of sauce flies off his fork 
                and lands on PRINCESS MARGARET’s dress. 
                                     JACQUES (CONT’D)
                           Ma’am. The sauce. I can only 
                           apologise...
                A terrible silence. 
                                     PRINCESS MARGARET
                           Wipe.
                                     JACQUES
                           I beg your pardon?
                                     PRINCESS MARGARET
                           I said wipe.
                                     BRIDGET2
                               (gripping the table)
                           Oh God. Oh God...
                And JACQUES has no choice but to dab his napkin in the water 
                and start to wipe at the brown spots.
                                     PRINCESS MARGARET
                           I thought I couldn’t dislike the 
                           sauce more when it was on my plate.
                                     SONNY2
                           The sauce has been a disaster, 
                           ma’am, I’m so sorry.
                                     PRINCESS MARGARET
                           There’s no need for you to 
                           apologise.
                While NICHOLAS2 relishes this, PATRICK2 can’t bear it - it’s 
                too reminiscent of the kind of scene he witnessed as a child. 
                Surely someone can intervene...
                But JACQUELINE D’ALANTOUR, proud and haughty, can bear it no 
                more. She stands and walks the length of the table.
                                     JACQUES
                           Jacqueline, I have done something 
                           unpardonable. 
                                     JACQUELINE
                           Ma’am, let me help you.
                                     PRINCESS MARGARET
                           He spilled it. He should wipe it 
                           up! In fact, one feels that he 
                           might have had a great career in 
                           dry-cleaning if he hadn’t been 
                           blown off course.
      Patrick Melrose - 'Some Hope' - Ep3                                 30
                                     JACQUELINE
                           Allez, Jacques, that’s enough.
                                     PRINCESS MARGARET
                           There’s still a spot here. Wipe it 
                           up!
                                     JACQUELINE
                               (she has had enough)
                           Non, c’est vraiment insupportable! 
                                     PRINCESS MARGARET
                           What is ‘insupportable’ is to be 
                           showered in this revolting sauce! I 
                           needn’t remind you that your 
                           husband is Ambassador to the Court 
                           of St James!
                A silence, a stand-off. JACQUELINE snaps first, bobbing 
                briefly then heading out of the room. The door slams.
                                     PRINCESS MARGARET (CONT’D)
                           A silence. I don’t approve of 
                           silences!
                               (back to SONNY2)
                           I get sent fallow dear from 
                           Richmond Park. You have to be on 
                           the list. The Queen said to me ‘Put 
                           yourself on the list.’ So I did.
                                     SONNY2
                           How very sensible, ma’am.
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           What I admire about Princess 
                           Margaret is the way she puts 
                           everyone at their ease.
                Conversation resumes but PATRICK2 sits, frozen.
                                     MARY2
                           Are you all right?
        43      INT. HALLWAY, CHEATLEY, THE COTSWOLDS 1990 - NIGHT         43
                The main course is being cleared. Outside the dining room, 
                JACQUELINE D’ALANTOUR paces and curses in vicious French, 
                railing against P.M.
                She is watched from the stairs by BELINDA in her nightdress.
                                     JACQUELINE
                           Hello, little girl. Who are you?
                                     BELINDA
                           I’m Belinda. Is Princess Margaret 
                           in there?
      Patrick Melrose - 'Some Hope' - Ep3                                 31
                                     JACQUELINE
                           Oh yes. Why don’t you go and say 
                           hello?
        44      INT. DINING ROOM, CHEATLEY, THE COTSWOLDS 1990 - NIGHT     44
                The desert course is being served.
                                     PRINCESS MARGARET
                           Remind me, SONNY2, do you have any 
                           children?
                                     SONNY2
                           Yes, indeed ma’am, a daughter, 
                           seven years-old. 
                                     PRINCESS MARGARET
                           No male heir then.
                                     SONNY2
                           Even so, I’m very fond of her.
                Over to NICHOLAS2, monopolising PATRICK2, who’d much rather be 
                talking to MARY2.
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           Of course, in many ways I feel 
                           responsible. It was I, after all, 
                           who introduced the humble Miss 
                           Watson-Scott, as she was then, to 
                           the beau monde at your dear 
                           father’s house. Who knew then that 
                           she was destined to command the 
                           very heights of society? You’re 
                           very lucky, a reprobate like you, 
                           invited to this glittering 
                           occasion. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           And I’m eternally grateful.
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           How are you managing?
                                     PATRICK2
                           Dying for a drink. 
                BELINDA has entered, and loiters nervously by the door, 
                unseen except PATRICK2 and MARY2. WAITERS weave around her.
                PATRICK2 waves at BELINDA. She waves back. MARY2 notices.

                It’s quite delicious. You        Oh, dear. I wonder if someone                        **
                have my sympathy. I’ve never     should -                                             *

                did have to give up 
                cigarettes, which was quite 
                bad enough...                                                                         *

                               (to MARY2)
                           Will you excuse me?
                PATRICK2 goes round the table to BELINDA, watched by MARY2.
                                     PATRICK2 (CONT’D)
                           Were you looking for someone?
                                     BELINDA
                           I wanted to meet Princess Margaret.
                                     PATRICK2
                           I see. Well, believe me, you’d be 
                           much better off without. Why don’t 
                           we ask BRIDGET1 to come?
                But now NICHOLAS has spotted BELINDA.
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           Oh look! It’s a little person who 
                           can’t sleep!
                                     PRINCESS MARGARET
                           Who is it?
                                     SONNY2
                           I’m afraid it’s my daughter, ma’am.
                                     PRINCESS MARGARET
                           She should be in bed. 
                BRIDGET turns -
                                     BRIDGET2
                           PATRICK2, thank you. What are you 
                           doing here, darling? This is a 
                           dinner for grown-ups.
                                     BELINDA
                           Which one’s Princess Margaret?
                                     JACQUELINE
                               (returning, mischievously)
                           Why don’t you get your mother to 
                           present you to her?
                                     BELINDA
                           Will you BRIDGET2? Please?

                PATRICK2 winces, BRIDGET2 hesitates. Meanwhile -
                                     PRINCESS MARGARET
                           Do you have any politics?
                                     SONNY2
                           Conservative, ma’am!
                BRIDGET and BELINDA arrive and wait patiently, PATRICK 
                nearby, watching.
                                     PRINCESS MARGARET
                           So I assumed, but are you involved 
                           in politics? For my own part, I 
                           don’t mind who’s in government so 
                           long as they’re good at governing. 
                           What we must avoid at all costs is 
                           these windscreen wipers: left, 
                           right, left, right...
                                     BRIDGET2
                           Ma’am, I wonder if I could 
                           introduce...
                                     PRINCESS MARGARET
                           Not now. She ought to be in bed. 
                           She’ll just get over-excited.
                                     SONNY2
                           Quite right. Honestly darling, how 
                           did she escape?
                BRIDGET2 looks at her husband with pure contempt.
                A moment, and she takes her daughter’s hand and walks briskly 
                out of the room.
                PATRICK2, too, watches all of this with a terrible sense of 
                recognition. What am I doing here? Get me out, get me out...
                                     SONNY2 (CONT’D)
                           And now I think perhaps we should 
                           join the others.
                                     PRINCESS MARGARET
                           Must we? We’ve been having such a 
                           cosy time. I do so hate big 
                           parties.
                                     SONNY2
                           Oh, me too. It was my BRIDGET1’s idea..
        45      EXT/INT. PARTY, CHEATLEY, THE COTSWOLDS 1990 - NIGHT       45
                The Party
      Patrick Melrose - 'Some Hope' - Ep3                                 34
                The following sequence should have a sense of movement, of 
                continuous action, tuning in and out of conversations, 
                replicating the experience in real time. A single, flowing 
                take, or at least the illusion of one. 
                PART X EXT. MARQUEE / MARQUEE TERRACE (NIGHT FOR NIGHT): 
                Behind the house the band is on a small stage inside the 
                marquee, playing CANDLES ON THE CAKE.
                PART 1 EXT/INT. FRONT DRIVEWAY / ENTRANCE LOBBY (N/N):
                In front of the house PATRICK smokes with the trepidation of 
                a man about to face a firing squad. Guests are arriving, and 
                among them we find CINDY SMITH, an American model, impossibly 
                glamorous, and DAV WINFALL, not so glamorous.
                                     CINDY
                           Sonny and I are so grateful to you.
                                     DAV
                           Anything for Sonny. Try to avoid 
                           Bridget though. She can be rather 
                           fierce.
                                     CINDY
                           Of course -
                                     DAV
                           If security asks, you’re to pretend 
                           to be my wife.
                                     CINDY
                           How far am I meant to go?
                They join the party inside the house, and PATRICK2 looks after 
                them. He turns back to the arriving cars and sees - 
                DEBBIE, ex-girlfriend, talking to JULIA2, now JULIA2 BROGLIE, 
                his ex-lover, and glaring AMANDA.
                 PATRICK2 hurries indoors - a hand on his arm.
                                     GEORGE
                           My dear, what a nice surprise!
                PART 2 INT. ENTRANCE LOBBY (NIGHT FOR NIGHT):
                GEORGE WATFORD, very elderly now, sits in a chair in the 
                entrance hall. PATRICK2 is genuinely pleased to see him. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           George!
                                     GEORGE
                           I’m sitting here because I can’t 
                           hear anything otherwise.
      Patrick Melrose - 'Some Hope' - Ep3                                 35
                                     PATRICK2
                               (sitting)
                           I thought people were supposed to 
                           lead lives of quiet desperation.
                                     GEORGE
                           Not quiet enough. Have you found 
                           something you enjoy doing?
                                     PATRICK2
                           Yes, but sadly I’ve had to give 
                           that up. 
                                     GEORGE
                           Then you’re guilty of the greatest 
                           sin of all. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           Am I?
                                     GEORGE
                           Wasting time. You must make a 
                           contribution. No man is an island, 
                           though there are a surprising 
                           number here who own one. And not 
                           just in Scotland. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           Of course you’re right. My DAVID1 
                           once said to me ‘if you have a 
                           talent, use it. Or you’ll be 
                           miserable all your life.’ It was 
                           almost the only non-hostile remark 
                           DAVID1 ever made. 
                                     GEORGE
                           He was a very brilliant man, but 
                           never happy I think. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           Yes, well, I hardly ever think 
                           about him these days. 
                                     GEORGE
                           Whatever you feel, DAVID1 would have 
                           hated you to make the same 
                           mistakes. PATRICK2 -

                           No more wasted time.
                This hits its mark.

                PART 3 INT. ENTRANCE LOBBY / MAIN LOBBY / MUSIC ROOM (N/N):
                Leaving George, he continues to move into the next room where 
                he suddenly finds himself facing DEBBIE. She’s not pleased to 
                see him.
                                     DEBBIE
                           PATRICK2.
                                     PATRICK2
                           Debbie. You look lovely. But you 
                           always did at parties.
                                     DEBBIE
                           I’m surprised you can remember. You  
                           were either upstairs in bed with 
                           someone else, or passed out in the 
                           loo - 
                                     PATRICK2
                           Yes, well, that’s something I 
                           wanted to talk to you about. I 
                           don’t think I was terribly nice to 
                           you and -
                                     DEBBIE
                           I know this one. It’s a twelve-step 
                           thing, isn’t it? I’m on your ‘moral 
                           inventory’. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           No, I just - 
                                     DEBBIE
                           Will you excuse me?
                And while PATRICK2 winces, she heads off past -
                                     SONNY2
                               (coming down the stairs)
                           Dav, Cindy! You made it!
                                     CINDY
                           Happy Birthday, darling.
                                     DAV
                           SONNY2, are you sure this is all 
                           above board? BRIDGET1 just gave me 
                           the most terrible scowling look.
                                     SONNY2
                           Just stick to our story. You met 
                           Cindy, wife couldn’t come, asked 
                           her instead, didn’t check, nothing 
                           to do with me.

                                     DAV
                           Right. So, met Cindy, wife couldn’t 
                           come, asked Cindy instead...
                DAV sidles off. SONNY2 takes CINDY to a quieter corner of 
                the room and regards her with barely-concealed lust.
                                     SONNY2
                           Hello there. 
                                     CINDY
                           Happy Birthday, darling. 
                A kiss, a whisper. NICHOLAS2 and PATRICK2 watch this encounter 
                as we move in on them.
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           What I find with beautiful women is 
                           that, after one’s waited around for 
                           ages, they all arrive at once, as 
                           buses are supposed to do. Not that 
                           I’ve ever waited around for a bus. 
                           Oh look there’s Princess Margaret. 
                           One has to be careful not to trip 
                           over her. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           That was quite a scene.
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           Yes, I do admire P.M., she has 
                           something of DAVID1’s joie-de-
                           vivre. Imagine if they’d met!
                                     PATRICK2
                           Imagine. 
                But PATRICK2’s eye is drawn to BRIDGET2, who also watches 
                SONNY2, silent and despairing and drinking heavily.
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           The way she used a minor accident 
                           to screw the maximum humiliation 
                           out of the Ambassador. Of course 
                           I’m absolutely devoted to his wife 
                           who, behind all that phoney chic, 
                           is a genuinely malicious person -
                           (JACQUES and JACQUELINE arrive)
                           And here they are!
                                     PATRICK2
                           Will you excuse me? I must talk to 
                           our hostess.
                                     JACQUELINE
                           I hope we didn’t drive away your 
                           young friend. He seemed very 
                           nervous. 
      Patrick Melrose - 'Some Hope' - Ep3                                 38
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           Oh, we can do without him. Mon cher 
                           Jacques, I thought you were 
                           absolutely brilliant, the way you 
                           handled that tiresome woman...
                PATRICK2 has followed BRIDGET2 into the music room, has taken 
                her by the hand and sat her down. But now PRINCESS MARGARET 
                is approaching.
                                     JACQUES
                           Thank you, but I feel the royal 
                           presence bearing down on us. 
                           Perhaps we should explore the 
                           depths of the party. 
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           My dear fellow you are the depths 
                           of the party. Au revoir!
                And they flee, just as PRINCESS MARGARET arrives and walks 
                with him into the music room.
                                     PRINCESS MARGARET
                           Consorting with the enemy?
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           They came to me for sympathy, but I 
                           told them they’d come to the wrong 
                           place! He’s a clumsy fool, and as 
                           to his absurd wife...
                AMANDA PRATT arrives, smiling, interrupting NICHOLAS.
                                     AMANDA
                           Hello there! Isn’t this a lovely 
                           party?
                               (a nod to P.M.)
                           Ma’am.
                                     NICHOLAS2
                               (chilly)
                           I’ll come and find you later. 
                           Alright?
                AMANDA heads off, downcast.
                                     PRINCESS MARGARET
                           Who was that?
                                     NICHOLAS
                           My daughter. Now where was I, I’ve 
                           quite lost my flow -
                ...and now over P.M.’s shoulder, to BRIDGET2 and PATRICK2, 
                talking fondly. 
      Patrick Melrose - 'Some Hope' - Ep3                                 39
                                     BRIDGET2
                           ...the main thing I remember, apart 
                           from your poisonous DAVID1, was 
                           that beautiful house.
                                     PATRICK2
                           Nothing compared to all of this. 
                                     BRIDGET2
                           Yes, funny how things turn out. 
                           It’s all lovely, I just wish it 
                           wasn’t full of such awful shits. 
                           Not you, of course. Or VIRGINIA1 -
                Behind PATRICK2, VIRGINIA2 has wandered into the party, rather 
                dazed, clutching her large handbag.
                                     PATRICK2
                           You seemed so incredibly cool to 
                           me. Not like my parents’ usual 
                           crowd at all. And so kind too. When 
                           you’re young you notice kindness.
                                     BRIDGET2
                           Kind. You’re sure you’re not 
                           confusing me with someone else? -
                               (VIRGINIA2’s passing)
                           You wouldn’t be an angel and talk 
                           to her for a second, would you?
                               (before he can object)
                           VIRGINIA2? This is my old friend 
                           PATRICK2 Melrose...
                PATRICK2 smiles at VIRGINIA2.
                                     PATRICK2
                           So! Quite a party!
                PART 4 INT. MUSIC ROOM / MAIN LOBBY / BLUE DRAWING RM (N/N):
                - and now we follow BRIDGET into the main hall as she tracks 
                SONNY, still talking to CINDY. DAV intercepts her, sweaty 
                and eager for exoneration.
                                     DAV
                           Bridget! Lovely party! I just 
                           wanted to clarify - I met Cindy, my 
                           wife couldn’t come...
                But she brushes past him and watches as, in the drawing room, 
                SONNY2 grabs a glass of champagne, presses it on CINDY, who 
                places one hand, momentarily, on her stomach. SONNY2 laughs, 
                touches that hand tenderly, whispers in her ear, then turns 
                back.
                Quickly, BRIDGET2 turns out of sight, shaken, confused - 
                - as TONY FOWLES arrives; coked-up, melodramatic.
      Patrick Melrose - 'Some Hope' - Ep3                                 40
                                     TONY FOWLES
                           What is it, darling?
                                     BRIDGET2
                           Oh, I just saw Cindy Smith with 
                           SONNY1. I said we shouldn’t invite 
                           her because we didn’t know her and 
                           now she’s here and...oh, I’m just 
                           being paranoid.
                                     TONY FOWLES
                           Yes. Probably.
                                     BRIDGET2
                           Probably paranoid?
                                     TONY FOWLES
                               (a moment’s thought, then)
                           Is there somewhere we can go?
                And as she takes him by the arm, BRIDGET2 looks back, but 
                SONNY2 has disappeared. 
                PART 5 EXT. MARQUEE / MARQUEE TERRACE (NIGHT FOR NIGHT):
                Patrick is outside on the lawn, watching the crowd dance in 
                the marquee. SONNY2, now drunk, joins him -
                                     SONNY2
                           PATRICK2 Melrose, why aren’t you 
                           drinking?
                On stage, the BAND LEADER is introducing each musician, after 
                which they play a brief solo.
                                     PATRICK2

                I saw you talking to BRIDGET1.    And on cornet, ‘CHILLY WILLY2’                        *
                Is she having fun, d’you         Watson!                                              *
                think? She does look                                                                  *

                PATRICK2 hears the BAND LEADER’s announcement and strains to 
                see the cornet player, but -

                               (a rescue)
                           Sonny, may I steal PATRICK2 for one 
                           moment?

                               (still staring - could it 
                                be?)
                           Everything alright?
                                     PATRICK2
                           What? Yes, I thought I -  
                                     JOHNNY2
                           Let’s go here -
                               (a little quieter)
                           I thought I’d save you from our 
                           host.
                And we return to SONNY2 in the crowd - an urgent, whispered 
                conversation with CINDY. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           There’s a blast of palpable 
                           stupidity that comes from that man, 
                           like opening the door of a sauna.
                               (Anxious, SONNY2 hurries 
                                through the crowd)
                           My God, look at them all. I 
                           remember these people from my 
                           childhood. Hard and dull. 
                                     JOHNNY2
                           They’re the last Marxists.
                               (PATRICK2 - ‘go on’)
                           The last people to believe class is 
                           a total explanation. When they’ve 
                           lost that doctrine in Peking and 
                           Moscow, it’ll still flourish under 
                           the marquees of England. The true 
                           heirs of Marx and Lenin.

                           And a little bit of 
                           Gloucestershire. Let’s get out of 
                           here.
                But JULIA2 arrives - 
                                     JULIA2
                           What are you two muttering about? 
                           Hello, stranger -
                               (kissing his cheek)
                           Oh, Christ -
                               (arriving -)
                           JOHNNY2, PATRICK2, this is my 
                           husband, Angus.
                Bearded, Scottish, a little dull. They shake hands.
                                     ANGUS
                           Quite a party. Must have cost a 
                           pretty penny!

                                     JULIA2
                           My husband is obsessed with how 
                           much everything costs. Why don’t 
                           you go and get me a drink. They’re 
                           free. JOHNNY2 will help you.
                                     PATRICK2
                           Actually, JOHNNY2 and I were about 
                           to -
                A glance of exasperation from JOHNNY1 as he leaves with ANGUS.
                                     JULIA2
                               (watching ANGUS)
                           My husband. He looked so good on 
                           paper but he’s completely obsessed 
                           with whether a cheap-day return is 
                           refundable if you don’t use the 
                           second half. 
                               (PATRICK2 laughs)
                           Shall we go exploring?
                               (they head into the house, 
                                JULIA2 still holding her 
                                champagne glass)
                           It’s very good to see you again. I 
                           thought perhaps you’d been avoiding 
                           me. As a bad influence.
                                     PATRICK2
                           Not you. The world.
                                     JULIA2
                           You’re here now. Perhaps we can 
                           liven up this dreary party.
                                     PATRICK2
                           You certainly have to kick a lot of 
                           bodies before you find a live one.
                                     JULIA2
                           Tony’s got some charlie, but I 
                           suppose that’s against the rules.
                In the crowd, we find TONY FOWLES, who is slipping a wrap of 
                cocaine to AMANDA.
                                     PATRICK2
                           I think technically, yes. 
                                     JULIA2
                           Christ, why are you all so dull? 
                           Men used to tell me how they used 
                           butter for sex. Now they tell me 
                           how they’ve eliminated it from 
                           their diet. Look, there’s Debbie.
                               (DEBBIE joins TONY)
                           Doesn’t she look beautiful?

                                     PATRICK2
                           Very. Well, I’d better go find 
                           JOHNNY1 - 
                                     JULIA2
                           We could always go upstairs. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           Upstairs. What for?
                                     JULIA2
                           For sex. No strings. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           Well, I suppose it’s something to 
                           do.
                                     JULIA2
                           Thank you.
                                     PATRICK2
                           No, no, I’m really keen.
                                     JULIA2
                           Well then, let’s go. Before my 
                           husband gets back.
                PART 6 INT. DINING ROOM / BLUE DRAWING ROOM (N/N):
                PATRICK2 and JULIA2 move through the house. At the bottom of 
                the stairs, they approach a SECURITY GUARD.
                                     SECURITY GUARD
                           I’m sorry, ma’am, the house is 
                           closed to - 
                                     JULIA2
                               (with supreme confidence)
                           We’re staying here.
                The SECURITY GUARD hesitates but shrinks under her glare, 
                lets them through.
                                     JULIA2 (CONT’D)
                           Thank you!
                PART 7 INT. LANDING / STAIRCASE (NIGHT FOR NIGHT):
                Up the stairs -
                                     PATRICK2
                           I can’t help thinking this is a 
                           terrible idea.
                                     JULIA2
                           Shhhh! Listen!
                The sound of shouting is coming from the end of the hall. 
      Patrick Melrose - 'Some Hope' - Ep3                                 44
                There we can see SONNY1 and BRIDGET1, their furious row 
                happening simultaneously with JULIA2 and PATRICK2’s 
                conversation.
                As PATRICK2 and JULIA2 listen in -
                                     BRIDGET1
                           ...and you invited her! Here, to 
                           our home, with our daughter 
                           sleeping upstairs, surely you can 
                           see how... monstrous and 
                           humiliating that is?
                             SONNY1                     BRIDGET1 (CONT'D)
                Could we perhaps talk about      No! We will talk about it now 
                it in the morning?               - 
                                     SONNY1
                            - because the guests are going to 
                           start wondering where we - 
                                     BRIDGET1
                           I don’t CARE about your fucking 
                           guests! Tell me - is it the first 
                           time she’s been here?
                                     SONNY1
                           What?
                                     BRIDGET1
                           To the house, is this the first 
                           time she has been a guest in our 
                           house?
                                     SONNY1
                           Yes! 
                                     BRIDGET1
                           Sonny - 
                                     SONNY1
                           No. No, she has been here once, 
                           maybe twice before - 
                                     BRIDGET1
                           And where was I?
                                     SONNY1
                           In London, I think, seeing friends. 
                                     BRIDGET1
                           And did you fuck her here?
                                     SONNY1
                           What?
                                     BRIDGET1
                           Did. You. Fuck. Her -

                           I don’t have to answer all these 
                           quest -
                                     BRIDGET1
                           Did you fuck her here?
                                     SONNY1
                           Yes, but not in our bedroom!
                                     JULIA2
                           You must have heard.
                                     PATRICK2
                           About the affair?
                                     JULIA2
                           It gets better. Cindy’s pregnant. 
                           With a precious boy-child. SONNY1’s 
                           so desperate for a male heir he’s 
                           going to make Cindy the next 
                           Countess of Gravesend.

                           Poor BRIDGET1. 
                                     JULIA2
                           - like some sort of tin-pot Henry 
                           VIII. Honestly, you have to laugh.
                                     PATRICK2
                           Well, you don’t have to laugh.
                                     JULIA2
                           Don’t be so pious. Serves her 
                           right.
                                     PATRICK2
                           What for?
                                     JULIA2
                           You know what for. All that 
                           climbing. No wonder she looks so 
                           tired.
                                     PATRICK2
                           You know, I have my reservations 
                           about your character. 
                                     JULIA2
                           Oh, me too!
                BRIDGET2, tearful but furious, is walking away from a dazed 
                SONNY1. JULIA1 hears her approach -

                And she takes his hand and takes him along, and we leave THE 
                PARTY.
        46      INT. NURSERY, CHEATLEY, THE COTSWOLDS 1990 - NIGHT         46
                In the dark room, PATRICK2 and JULIA2 are beginning to make 
                love, standing against the wall. It’s very passionate, so 
                much so that JULIA2’s champagne glass falls and breaks. 
                                     JULIA2
                           Guess who I’m having an affair 
                           with?
                                     PATRICK2
                           Do we have to discuss this now?
                                     JULIA2
                           Your friend JOHNNY1.
                                     PATRICK2
                           Well, that’s put me right off.
                                     JULIA2
                               (an attempt at reignition)
                           I thought you might want to steal 
                           me back. JOHNNY1’s perfectly nice 
                           but that’s the problem.
                               (she kisses him)
                           I was so pleased when I heard you 
                           were coming tonight. PATRICK2 
                           Melrose. It took me by surprise. 
                           The fact is, I’ve missed you.
                                     PATRICK2
                           Me too. But I think...I think I’d 
                           rather stay friends with JOHNNY1.
                                     JULIA2
                           Really?
                                     PATRICK2
                           I don’t want more irony and 
                           tension.
                                     JULIA2
                           But you love irony and tension!
                                     PATRICK2
                           You just imagine everyone’s like 
                           you.
                                     JULIA2
                           Fuck off, PATRICK2 
                                     PATRICK2
                           Look, we’d better part now, don’t 
                           you think? Before we have a row.

                           God, you’re a pain.
                The door closes, and PATRICK2 is alone again.
                He lights a cigarette, looks around for somewhere to use as 
                an ashtray. The doll’s house? He sees JULIA’s broken 
                champagne glass. He throws the cigarette out the window, and 
                picks it up- 
                He holds the glass in his hand a moment. A memory. Then, 
                walking with some purpose, he heads out -

                           What are you doing here?

                           Sorry. Came up with a girl.

                           Oh God, I feel old. So much for 
                           security -

                           own parties. I’m going to find my

                And he continues down the stairs -

                Early ‘90s dance music - ‘Groove is in the Heart’ perhaps. 
                The young have indeed taken ecstasy, and the lights are 
                flashing, young and old dancing a little awkwardly. A rave in 
                dinner-jackets - very, very uncool. Thoughtful, PATRICK2 
                surveys this strange world. JOHNNY2’s by his side.

                           I was looking for you. Where have 
                           you been?

                           Nowhere. I wonder - can we find 
                           somewhere to talk?

                With some urgency -
                                     PATRICK2
                           I told you there was something I’ve 
                           never said out loud and never 
                           would. And now I’m going to. 
                           Forgive my inarticulacy, it’s not 
                           that I’m embarrassed, it’s...I 
                           don’t want it to be a burden for 
                           you.

                           Go ahead.
                                     PATRICK2
                           So. I’ve told you about my parents’ 
                           drunkenness and the violence, but 
                           what I was skirting around was - 
                A WAITER enters, offering drinks.
                                     PATRICK2/JOHNNY2
                           No thank you/Not now.

                                     JOHNNY2
                           Thank you.
                A pause, while the WAITER leaves. Finally -

                           DAVID1 ‘abused’ me as we’re invited 
                           to call it these days.
                A moment, as JOHNNY2 struggles to take this in.

                                flash of his father)
                           Look, do you think you could leave 
                           us alone for one fucking minute so 
                           we can have a conversation?

                           We’re not children, do we look like 
                           we’re interested in the fucking

                           What do I mean by abused? I mean 
                           sexually abused.
                                     JOHNNY2
                           God, I’m sorry. No wonder you hated 
                           him so much. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           Well now you know. The first 
                           incident masqueraded as a 
                           punishment, though I never knew the 
                           crime which gave it a certain 
                           Kafkaesque charm -

                           What a bastard. It must have split 
                           the world in half.
                                     PATRICK2
                           Yes, I think that’s what happened. 
                           What makes you say that?
                                     JOHNNY2
                           It just seemed obvious.

                           When it was happening, in that 
                           moment - this will sound strange - 
                           there was a lizard on the wall, a 
                           gecko, bright green and I thought, 
                           if I can somehow put myself 
                           inside...I might get through this. 
                           Not much of an escape plan, I know. 
                           The point is now I’m exhausted by 
                           hating DAVID1. It’s not enough, and if 
                           I’m going to break into the world, 
                           not just this -
                               (the party)
                           - but the real world, to learn 
                           something, make a contribution, 
                           live rather than just survive, then 
                           I’m going to have to say these 
                           things out loud.
                A crackle and bang from outside. The fireworks have begun.

                           We’re missing the fireworks, if you 
                           want to -
                                     JOHNNY2
                           That’s alright.

        53      INT. BRIDGET’S BEDROOM, CHEATLEY, THE COTSWOLDS 1990 - NIGHT53
                BRIDGET hastily packs a suitcase. BELINDA is curled up asleep 
                on VIRGINIA2’s lap.
                                     VIRGINIA2
                           I wondered if perhaps you’d like 
                           your old room back?
                                     BRIDGET2
                               (snapping)
                           VIRGINIA2, I don’t know, let’s decide 
                           when we get there. 
                                     VIRGINIA2
                           Whatever makes you happy. 
                BRIDGET2, remorseful, takes in her mother cradling BELINDA. 
                She comes and sits with her.
                                     BRIDGET2
                           I’ve treated you dreadfully 
                           sometimes. Snobbishly.

                                     VIRGINIA2
                           Oh, no. Only sometimes. Your father 
                           always blamed that NICHOLAS1 Pratt 
                           man. You were such a nice girl 
                           until you met him, but then you 
                           started criticising everything at 
                           home, people you’d known all your 
                           life, perfectly nice people. Your 
                           father always loved you, but I 
                           can’t pretend he wasn’t hurt 
                           sometimes. Have I said too much?
                                     BRIDGET2
                           Not at all. 
                She takes her hand.  A moment, then - 
                                     VIRGINIA2
                           Let’s have a nice long talk 
                           tomorrow. We should probably get 
                           started. We’ve a long way to go.
        53A     INT. UPSTAIRS TERRACE, CHEATLEY, THE COTSWOLDS, 1990 - NIGHT53A
                JOHNNY2 and PATRICK2 stand in silence.
                                     JOHNNY2
                           I’m not recruiting, I swear -
                                     PATRICK2
                           Go on -
                                     JOHNNY2
                           But perhaps the only way to move on 
                           is to become more detached about 
                           yourself and more attached to 
                           something else -
                                     PATRICK2
                           A hobby you mean -
                                     JOHNNY2
                           - or someone else -
                                     PATRICK2
                           Fall in love, have kids -
                                     JOHNNY2
                           Why not?
                                     PATRICK2
                           I tried falling in love, many 
                           times, as you know -
                                     JOHNNY2
                           Not sure I’d call that love -

                                     PATRICK2
                           Even so, my experience of love is 
                           that you get excited thinking 
                           someone can mend your broken heart, 
                           disappointed when you realise they 
                           can’t.
                                     JOHNNY2
                           But the next time.
                                     PATRICK2
                           Hm. Of course, the other danger is 
                           that without bitterness, spite, 
                           sarcasm, snobbery and self-
                           loathing, there might be nothing 
                           left.
                                     JOHNNY2
                           Perhaps. Or think what you could 
                           put there instead.

                As fireworks continue, PRINCESS MARGARET, a little woozy now, 
                is retreating, pursued by an inebriated JACQUES D’ALANTOUR.
                                     JACQUES
                           Ma’am! Ma’am, wait. Ma’am, I wished 
                           to apologise. I think it was 
                           Talleyrand who said -
                VIRGINIA2, BRIDGET2 and the sleeping BELINDA are struggling 
                down the stairs with the suitcase. 
                                     PRINCESS MARGARET
                           Ah, there’s our hostess! I wanted 
                           to find SONNY1...
                BRIDGET2 regards the Princess coldly. Then -
                                     BRIDGET2
                           I really couldn’t care less. Ma’am.
                And they hurry off, leaving P.M. alone. 
        55      EXT. DRIVE, CHEATLEY, THE COTSWOLDS 1990 - NIGHT           55
                SONNY2, GEORGE, and NICHOLAS2 are smoking cigarettes in a 
                huddle near the entrance.
                                     SONNY2
                           I’ve been a bloody fool.
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           I can’t say I disagree.

                Behind them, as SONNY2 speaks, BRIDGET2, VIRGINIA2 and BELINDA 
                get into their car -
                                     SONNY2
                           But I was driven to it! BRIDGET1’s 
                           not having a son has been 
                           frightfully hard but I’m not sure I 
                           like the idea of life without her. 
                           And Cindy has got some very 
                           peculiar ideas. She’s already 
                           suggested I knock a wall through, 
                           and the way she looks at the 
                           furniture, like a bloody auctioneer 
                           -

                           Isn’t that BRIDGET2 now?
                The engine starts, and SONNY2 drops his glass and starts to 
                run after it.
                                     SONNY2
                           BRIDGET2! BRIDGET2, where are you 
                           going! Stop! Stop the car!
                VIRGINIA2 looks back through the rear window and sees her son-
                in-law on the grand drive behind them, gasping.
                She allows herself a smile.

                A general exodus is taking place. The BAND are packing their 
                stuff away, WAITERS are clearing up glasses. 
                PATRICK2 and JOHNNY2 walk towards the car.
                                     PATRICK2
                           I wonder if there’s some 
                           alternative to hatred.

                           Forgiveness?
                                     PATRICK2
                           Oh, I’m sure DAVID1 was 
                           intensely unhappy, but to forgive 
                           someone, doesn’t there have to be 
                           some effort to change?

                           need forgiving -
                The INSENSITIVE WAITER is passing with a tray of glasses. 
                PATRICK2 spots him.  
                                     PATRICK2
                           Excuse me, hello. Look, I’m sorry 
                           if I snapped at you earlier, I was 
                           in the middle of saying something 
                           rather tricky.
                                     WAITER
                           I was only doing my job.
                                     PATRICK2
                           Of course you were, and I 
                           apologise.
                                     JOHNNY2
                           So do you think there’s any way to 
                           forgive him?
                                     WAITER
                           Of course. It wasn’t that bad.
                                     JOHNNY2
                           No, not you!
                JOHNNY2 and PATRICK2 laugh. The WAITER tuts and leaves.
                                     PATRICK2
                           Well if the waiter can forgive 
                           me... You go ahead. I don’t think 
                           I’ll be able to sleep yet, and the 
                           thought of that hotel room -
                                     JOHNNY2
                           Well - thanks for telling me.

                           No need to get Californian about 
                           it.

                JOHNNY2 walks away, past the band, and the cornet player that 
                PATRICK2 noticed earlier. 
                Is it possible? He walks closer, stares quite openly. CHILLY

                           Your wife once sold me a horse 
                           syringe for twenty dollars. It was 
                           like this -

                           Yeah, she OD’ed.
                                     PATRICK2
                           Oh, I’m sorry. Still, it’s a 
                           miracle you’re alive.
                                     CHILLY WILLY2
                           You too. But then everything’s a 
                           miracle, man. It’s a miracle that 
                           we don’t melt in the bath like a 
                           piece of soap.

                           Nice to meet you.
                PATRICK2 turns and sees MARY2, walking towards him. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           You too - 
                               (a thought - why not?)
                           See you at breakfast perhaps. 
                                     MARY2
                           Yes. Why not? The Cotswold Carvery? 
                                     PATRICK2
                           Around nine perhaps.
                                     MARY2
                           Avoid disappointment.
                And she walks on, smiling. PATRICK2 watches MARY2 go.

                And now PATRICK2 is alone, walking away from the house, the 
                smoke from the fireworks still hanging in the air.
                It’s very late - almost early - and there’s the hint of a 
                lightening in the eastern sky. 
                Still, he’s not quite ready for sleep. Instead he strides off 
                across the grass towards an ornamental lake. 
                At the edge of the water, he stops and lights his last 
                cigarette and crumples the pack.
                PATRICK2 bends down, finds a stick, feels its weight in his 
                hand and hurls it out into the lake.
                As it breaks the water -
                                                                   CUT TO:

                A BLUR OF MOTION through broken vines, as a YOUNG BOY tumbles 
                down the serried terraces that cover the steep slope beneath 
                the chateau. He slashes at the vines left and right with his 
                plastic sword, leaping over the terraced walls, flying 
                almost.

                In a clearing stands a well, its depths concealed with a 
                wooden cover. THE BOY approaches and climbs up onto the edge. 
                He points his toe, tests the air above the well. 
                Then JUMPS. And lands. 
                Concrete. Dead leaves. The well has been sealed. No longer

                ROBERT2 MELROSE stops immediately, caught in the act, then 
                jumps down and runs back towards the house.

                PATRICK MELROSE, twelve years older than the man at the 
                party, shouts across the diminished grounds. 
                He is joined by MARY, who carries their second son THOMAS.
                They stand and watch their son hurtling towards the house.

                A figure sits in the spot that overlooks the vineyard, 
                Eleanor’s favourite spot. A NURSE carries a tray and sets it

                ROBERT2, 10 years-old now, walks the rooms of PATRICK1’s silent 
                childhood home, opening doors, re-familiarising himself - and 
                us - with the place. 
                In the drawing room, yoga mats, guitars and drums. Confined 
                to the corner, a shape beneath a dust sheet.
                ROBERT2 pulls back a corner, revealing David’s beloved piano. 
                He plays a high note, taps out a tune.

                MORNING
                The old dining room has become ELEANOR’s bedroom. Robert 
                stands outside a door and watches. From his P.O.V. - 
      Patrick Melrose - 'Mother's Milk' - Ep 4                              2
                ELEANOR1 sits up in bed in the darkened room. A series of 
                terrible strokes have taken their toll, and she looks frail 
                and bewildered and trapped, her face lop-sided, her eyes 
                cloudy.
                A NURSE sits at her side - CLAUDINE, her carer - and puts a 
                cup to her lip. ROBERT2 wonders - should I enter? A whisper -

                           go to the airport. Granny is 
                           waiting.
                ROBERT2 clearly doesn’t relish this.

                PATRICK2 MELROSE, now very much in middle-age, lies contorted, 
                sleeping fitfully. On his bedside table, bottles of pills. 
                Suitcases, yet to be unpacked. 
                A SMALL CHILD tumbles down on his face, causing him to yelp 
                in pain and surprise. 
                                       PATRICK2

                           Sorry! Sorry, sorry, sorry Thomas!
                THOMAS, ROBERT1’s younger brother, bounces on the bed.
                                       PATRICK2 (CONT’D)
                           I was just finally dropping off. 
                           I’ve been awake all night.

                           Yes, I thought so too, but we’ve 
                           been up since five, haven’t we 
                           Thomas? 
                                 (a kiss goodbye)
                           We’re off to fetch my mother from

                                       MARY2
                           There’s lots to do. Open all the 
                           windows, air the place.

                           If you could finish unpacking, that 
                           would be very helpful -
                He closes his eyes. A beat, then - 
                The strum of a guitar, the patter of drums. A jam session.  
                PATRICK2 crosses to the window. 
                That wonderful Provençal view, but now on the lawn three 
                figures sit, legs crossed, one of them tapping on the drums.
                PATRICK2 scowls, swears. On the warpath, he crosses to the 
                wardrobe, opens the door - 
                Leaflets, paraphernalia, cardboard boxes full of books.

                MARY is just getting into the car when PATRICK2 strides past 
                in t-shirt and pyjama bottoms, his feet rammed into unlaced 
                brogues. In his arms, a bulging box of books and leaflets, 
                all balanced on a cheap notice-board. Forced brightness -
                                       PATRICK2
                           Have a nice trip! Goodbye!
                                       MARY2
                           At least wait until we’ve unpacked - 
                                       PATRICK2
                           I’m just going to say hello! Drive 
                           safely!
                And on he strides to -

                SEAMUS2, late forties, beaming and bright, sits with his 
                acolytes, KEVIN and ANNETTE2. 
                                       SEAMUS2
                           Ah, PATRICK2! I thought I heard your 
                           car last night. Welcome back! 
                           ELEANOR1 can’t wait to see you. This 
                           is Kevin, ANNETTE2 -
                                       ANNETTE2/KEVIN
                           Hey, PATRICK2!/Halloooo!
      Patrick Melrose - 'Mother's Milk' - Ep 4                              4
                                       SEAMUS2
                           PATRICK2, we were just discussing  
                           how wonderful ELEANOR1 is, 
                           letting The Foundation use your 
                           beautiful home. Amazing woman. 
                           She’s helped so many people to 
                           connect. 
                                       PATRICK2
                           With what?
                                       SEAMUS2
                           With other realities. 
                                       PATRICK2
                           Yes, well, back in this one -
                                 (the box of books)
                           - when I opened my wardrobe this 
                           morning, there were so many copies 
                           of The Way of the Spirit that they 
                           were getting in the way of the 
                           shoes.  
                                       SEAMUS2
                           The Way of the Shoes. That’s 
                           actually the better title, 
                           reminding us to keep our feet on 
                           the ground. 
                                       PATRICK2
                           Do you think these signs of 
                           institutional life could be removed 
                           when we’re here on holiday? In 
                           August this is our family home.
                                       SEAMUS2
                           Of course. I apologise. 
                                       PATRICK2
                           These leaflets for reiki workshops 
                           and healing circles, they’re wasted 
                           on us. In fact this board, despite 
                           it’s attractive cork surface, is 
                           yours not ours.
                                       SEAMUS2
                           I’ll take it to my cottage - 
                                       PATRICK2
                           ELEANOR1’s cottage -
                                       SEAMUS2
                           - where she lets me stay -
                                       PATRICK2
                           For how long? I thought you were 
                           going back to Ireland.
      Patrick Melrose - 'Mother's Milk' - Ep 4                              5
                                       SEAMUS2
                           No, I’m staying for the summer. You 
                           won’t know I’m here!
                PATRICK2 manages to stop himself. He turns and leaves, 
                snatching some rogue wind-chimes from the tree as he passes. 
                And SEAMUS watches him go, his good-humour unshakable.
        10      INT. KITCHEN, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 2003 - MORNING          10
                Back inside the house, PATRICK2 takes a moment to calm down. 
                The day is getting hotter already, and he takes a glass of 
                water, fills it, drinks it, goes to put it down - 
                A SCORPION, tiny and delicate, skitters over the draining 
                board. He contemplates killing it, hesitates, takes a glass, 
                places it over the tiny creature. CLAUDINE, ELEANOR1’s nurse, 
                enters.
                                       CLAUDINE
                           Monsieur Melrose? 
                                       PATRICK2
                           Bonjour Claudine! Comment est ma 
                           ELEANOR1?
                                       CLAUDINE
                           Si vous voulez monter, votre mère 
                           vous attend.
        11      INT. ELEANOR2’S ROOM, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 2003 - MORNING   11
                PATRICK2 enters the dim, stuffy room and crosses to ELEANOR2, 
                who sits in her bed. Even in the light, it’s clear that she 
                has transformed - thinning hair, snaggled teeth, a terrible 
                fearfulness locked into her eyes. Illness has blown her apart 
                like a dandelion clock, but she organises her face into a 
                smile and PATRICK2 does his best to put her at ease.
                                       ELEANOR2
                           I want you to know...that I’m very 
                           unhappy... at not being able 
                           to...communicate.
                                       PATRICK2
                                 (taking a seat)
                           It must be horrible.
                                       ELEANOR2
                           Yes. Horrible. Yes. But I am brave.
                An awkward silence. ELEANOR2 eyes an envelope on her bedside 
                table -

                                       PATRICK2
                           The others are at the airport, 
                           picking up MARY1’s mother. 
                                 (PATRICK2 picks it up, 
                                  opens.)
                           They’re all very keen to see you. 
                           Only when you’re feeling up to it. 
                           Thomas has grown, as you’d expect -
                                 (the contents)
                           What’s this?
                PATRICK2 opens and reads, while ELEANOR2 strains for words.
                                       ELEANOR2
                           Need you. 
                                       PATRICK2
                           I’m sorry, I’m just trying to - 
                                 (a deep breath)
                           This appears... If I understand 
                           correctly, you want to, you intend 
                           to give this house away.
                                       ELEANOR2
                           Yes -
                                       PATRICK2
                           To the Foundation, the 
                           Transpersonal Foundation, with 
                           immediate effect.
                                       ELEANOR2
                           Yes. Soon. Please, understand?
        12      EXT. DRIVEWAY, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 2003 - DAY             12
                The car returns. PATRICK2 comes out to meet them and, dazed 
                and furious, starts to unpack. Here’s KETTLE, MARY2’s mother - 
                sunglasses, flowing dress.
                                       PATRICK2
                           Good flight?
                                       KETTLE
                           Hello, Patrick. No, hideous. There 
                           was an awful woman next me who was 
                           terrifically proud of her breasts 
                           and kept sticking them in her 
                           child’s face.
                                       MARY2
                           It’s called breast-feeding.
      Patrick Melrose - 'Mother's Milk' - Ep 4                              7
                                       KETTLE
                           Thank you, darling. I know it’s all 
                           the rage but when I was having 
                           children, the clever woman was the 
                           one who went to the party looking 
                           as if she’d never been pregnant, 
                           not the one with her breasts 
                           hanging out. At least not for 
                           breast-feeding...oh!
                PATRICK is already walking away with KETTLE’s bag. 
                                       MARY2
                                 (hurrying after)
                           ROBERT2, can you show Granny to her 
                           room. 
                                       KETTLE
                           It’s not too near the children, is 
                           it?
        13      INT. HALLWAY, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 2003 - DAY              13
                KETTLE’s discarded suitcase stands on the landing. 
                                       MARY2 
                           PATRICK2? Where are you?
        14      INT. DRAWING ROOM, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 2003 - DAY         14
                She enters. PATRICK is pouring a glass of wine from a bottle, 
                largely empty. She is shocked, but tries not to betray this.
                                       MARY2
                                 (- the wine)
                           Goodness. What’s happened here? 
                                       PATRICK2
                           A temporary measure.
                                       MARY2
                           It’s been a while.
                                       PATRICK2
                                 (moving on, the letter)
                           ELEANOR1’s excelled herself this time. 
                           From the solicitors, care of my 
                           mother, if ‘care’ is the right 
                           word. I’ve been disinherited.
                                       MARY2
                           What?
      Patrick Melrose - 'Mother's Milk' - Ep 4                              8
                                       PATRICK2
                           ELEANOR1’s signing the house over to 
                           this joke charity. Nothing to us, 
                           nothing to the children. 
                                       MARY2
                           Oh, PATRICK2 -
                                       PATRICK2
                           Oh, and she wants to know if I’ll 
                           check for loopholes. It’s not 
                           enough to be disinherited, I have 
                           to chip in with the paperwork.
                                       MARY2
                           That’s awful. Did ELEANOR1 say why?
                                       PATRICK2
                           It took half the morning, but 
                           apparently she wants to ’do good’. 
                           ELEANOR1 wants to help people, anyone 
                           really, just as long as they’re not 
                           fucking related to her!
                                       MARY2
                           Not so loud!
                                       PATRICK2
                           Oh, and she ‘seeks closure’ and 
                           wants my ‘validation.’ That bastard 
                           SEAMUS1 might as well have been 
                           whispering in her fucking ear! 
                                       MARY2
                           Darling, you’re ranting -
                                       PATRICK2
                           I have to rant! ELEANOR1 was always a 
                           lousy mother, but I hoped she might 
                           take a holiday towards the end of 
                           her life, feel that she’d achieved 
                           enough by way of betrayal and 
                           neglect and that it was time to 
                           have a break, play with her 
                           grandchildren.

                ROBERT2 has left the others, and now stands outside the door, 
                listening in. INTERCUT -

                           What frightens me is how much I 
                           loathe her.

                           Reading that letter, I tried to 
                           loosen my collar so I could 
                           breathe, and then I realised it 
                           wasn’t my collar, it was actually a 
                           noose tightening around my neck, a 
                           noose of loathing...

                                       MARY2 
                           She’s a frightened old woman! 
                                       PATRICK2
                           I know!
                                 (quieter)
                           I know. What do I loathe then? I 
                           loathe the poison dripping down 
                           from generation to generation. I’d 
                           rather die than inflict the same 
                           thing on our children.

                           That won’t happen. Not if we don’t 
                           let it. 
                On ROBERT2, confused and troubled.

                Insomnia, as the cicadas compete with the click-click-click 
                of an oscillating electric fan. There are three in the bed 
                tonight - THOMAS sleeps soundly with MARY2, while PATRICK2 lies 
                wide-awake.

                In the kitchen, the scorpion is still under the upturned 
                glass. 
                Giving up on sleep, hung-over, PATRICK2 is making black 
                coffee. He sees the glass, lifts it, lets the scorpion 
                scamper away.

                Breakfast. KETTLE, in sun-hat, speaks in a low voice to MARY2, 
                while PATRICK2 drinks coffee and consults papers.
                                       KETTLE
                           She’s giving it all away?
                                       MARY2
                           To the charity, yes.
                                       KETTLE
                           Strange kind of charity. 
                A car is pulling up in the driveway. A new arrival. PATRICK2 
                springs to his feet, as ROBERT2 is approaching.
                                       MARY2
                           ROBERT2, go and say hello. 
                                 (under her breath)
                           I’m only telling you in case 
                           PATRICK2 seems a little off. 
                                       KETTLE
                           So he should be. It’s so lovely 
                           here. Nothing at all to the 
                           grandchildren? Goodness, what on 
                           earth did he do to her?
                                       MARY2
                           Nothing!
                Getting out of the car - 
                                       JULIA2
                           Hello there! 
                She’s joined by her daughter, LUCY, shy, the same age as 
                ROBERT2, who loiters shyly.
                                       MARY2
                           Let’s not talk about it, certainly 
                           not in front of the children.
                                       KETTLE
                           Who’s this now?
                                       MARY
                           I told you. It’s PATRICK2’s friend, 
                           JULIA1. Lucy’s her daughter. 
                PATRICK2 kisses and hugs JULIA2, as LUCY loiters.
                                       KETTLE
                           He certainly seems pleased to see 
                           her.

                           MARY2! Hello there!
                MARY2 forces a smile. 
                                       MARY2
                           He’s just being nice to her. She’s 
                           been having a hard time.
        21      EXT. GARDEN, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 2003 - AFTERNOON         21
                PATRICK and JULIA are lounging in the shade, drinking wine.
                                       PATRICK2
                           Most people wait for their parents 
                           to die with a mixture of sadness 
                           and plans for a new swimming pool. 
                           Seeing as I’m going to have to 
                           renounce the swimming pool, I 
                           thought I might ditch the sadness 
                           too.
                                       JULIA2
                           But can’t you fight it? You’re a 
                           barrister for Christ’s sake. 
                                       PATRICK2
                           She may be an un-maternal idiot, 
                           but it’s still her money. If she 
                           wants to blow the last of it on a 
                           New Age hotel, there’s nothing I 
                           can do to stop her. 
                                       JULIA2
                           Can’t you pretend to be a shaman 
                           and keep the place?
                                       PATRICK2
                           Sadly I’m one of the few people on 
                           the planet with absolutely no 
                           healing powers. 
                Nearby ROBERT2 and LUCY sit reading in silence, some distance 
                apart. 
                                       JULIA2
                           Why aren’t you playing with each 
                           other? Play! Play!
                                       PATRICK2
                           Besides, I have quite enough 
                           trouble looking after my family 
                           without saving the world. 
      Patrick Melrose - 'Mother's Milk' - Ep 4                             12
                                       JULIA2
                           I think looking after your children 
                           can be a way of giving up. 
                                 (PATRICK2 takes this in)
                           They become the whole ones, the 
                           well ones, the ones who don’t drink 
                           too much, get divorced, become 
                           mentally ill. You spend so much 
                           time guarding them from decay and 
                           depression that you end up decayed 
                           and depressed.
                                 (She takes PATRICK2’s 
                                  hand. ROBERT2 sees this)
                           I’m sorry, I’m a little down. Since 
                           the divorce I get these terrible 
                           moments of vertigo, like I don’t 
                           exist. 
                                       ROBERT2
                                 (listening in)
                           I get that!
                                       JULIA2
                           At your age? I think that’s very 
                           pretentious.
                                       ROBERT2
                           It’s true!
                                       PATRICK2
                           But it doesn’t stop you being a 
                           happy child, does it?
                                       ROBERT2
                           Sometimes, when it’s going on.
                Stung by JULIA2’s teasing, ROBERT2 stalks back to his mother.
                                       JULIA2
                                 (laughs, squeezes 
                                  PATRICK2’s hand)

                           Oh Christ, it’s the landlord.
                PATRICK2 picks up a book, turns his back to SEAMUS2.
                                       JULIA2
                           Am I allowed to talk to him?
                Back to MARY2 and ROBERT2 -

                                       ROBERT2
                           Why does she have to come on our 
                           holiday?
                                       MARY2
                           Well, JULIA1’s on her own now and 
                           daddy wants to cheer her up.
                                       ROBERT2
                           But why?
                                       MARY2
                           I think she makes him feel young. 
                           Look at him. Like a teenager.
                                       ROBERT2
                           I don’t think you like Julia very 
                           much.
                                       MARY2
                           ROBERT2! I do like her. But whereas 
                           clever people are just thinking 
                           aloud, JULIA1 is thinking about what 
                           she sounds like.
                                 (she watches JULIA1 
                                  talking with SEAMUS1)
                           I shouldn’t have said that. Don’t 
                           repeat it. 
                                       ROBERT2
                           Fine. But don’t make me play with 
                           Lucy. 
                                       MARY2
                           We won’t make you, we just thought 
                           it would be nice for you to spend 
                           time with someone your own age. 
                                       ROBERT2
                           You wouldn’t go to tea with someone 
                           just because she was 39. 
                                       MARY
                           Absolutely right. I hope your 
                           father’s not about to start another 
                           fight -
                JULIA2 and SEAMU2S are speaking, JULIA2 dry and sarcastic on 
                PATRICK2’s behalf, while he closes his eyes, bites his tongue.
                                       SEAMUS2
                           I’m writing a book, you see, about 
                           the healing work we do here. 
                                       JULIA2
                           Are you a healer yourself?
      Patrick Melrose - 'Mother's Milk' - Ep 4                             14
                                       PATRICK2
                                 (he can’t help himself)
                           Yes, Seamus, who have you healed?
                                       SEAMUS2
                           Well, I worked in a nursing home 
                           for many years, washing patients 
                           who were covered in their own 
                           faeces, spoon-feeding old people 
                           who couldn’t feed themselves, that 
                           kind of thing. I’m grateful for it. 
                           It kept me grounded. 
                                       PATRICK2
                           Well it’s a shame you didn’t stick 
                           with that, you might have actually 
                           done some tangible good. 
                                       SEAMUS2
                           PATRICK2 likes to keep me grounded 
                           too. But I think we do tangible 
                           good, with the courses we run.
                                       JULIA2
                           But why is it a charity? If people 
                           pay -
                                       SEAMUS2
                           We bring inner-city kids here. They 
                           love it, the meditation, the trance 
                           music, the drumming. They say to me 
                           ‘Seamus, this is incredible, it’s 
                           like tripping without drugs.’
                                       PATRICK2
                           Do we need a charity for tripping? 
                           Of all the ills in the world, it 
                           seems a wild hole to plug. Why not 
                           just give them acid?
                                       SEAMUS2
                           You can tell he’s a barrister!
                                       PATRICK2
                           I’m all for people having hobbies, 
                           but can’t they do it in the comfort 
                           of their homes?
                                       SEAMUS2
                           Sadly, some homes are not that 
                           comfortable.
                                       PATRICK2
                           No. I know the feeling.
                                       SEAMUS2
                           Well. Good to meet you, JULIA2 -

                                       SEAMUS2
                           Yes, she mentioned that.

                           I’m looking into it. Don’t go

                3 a.m. Another night without sleep. As MARY and THOMAS 
                slumber, PATRICK sits in an armchair, tries to read by the 
                bedside light. Impossible. He gets up -

                bedroom has been turned into the Foundations’s office, and 
                PATRICK2 sits with a glass of whisky, and goes through the 
                documents, the bank statements, the tax files -

                ELEANOR2 struggles to eat lunch with CLAUDINE nearby. She has 
                insisted on using the fork, but is finding it difficult.
                                       ELEANOR2
                           Can’t...find my mouth.
                MARY2 steps in, helping her. PATRICK2 finds himself struggling 
                between pity and rage. ROBERT2 observes this. ELEANOR2 shakes 
                her head - no more - and CLAUDINE leaves.

                           can do what you like, but if you 
                           give away too much, too soon - 
                                       PATRICK2
                           If you could just loan the house 
                           for the time being and decide -

                                 (hands over face)
                           I REALLY DO OBJECT!
                MARY2 does what PATRICK2 can’t do and puts her arms around 
                ELEANOR2, calming and soothing her. 
                                       PATRICK2
                           We’ll leave. You must be tired. I’m 
                           sorry if I upset you.
                She holds her hand out to ROBERT2. Confused, he goes over, 
                leans in to kiss her. She holds him, whispers in his ear.
                                       ELEANOR2
                           Don’t...leave me.
                                       ROBERT2
                           Now?
                Her hand is tight on his arm. 
                                       ELEANOR2
                           Don’t...no...
                But ROBERT2 steps back, turns away and leaves with his father.

                ROBERT2 watches PATRICK2 as he opens a bottle of wine, 
                frightened and confused. MARY2 enters
                                       PATRICK2
                           What can drive a man mad is being 
                           forced to have the emotion he’s 
                           being forbidden to have at the same 
                           time. The treachery makes me feel 
                           furious, and now I’m forced to feel 
                           pity. Well I’m a simple sort of man 
                           and I remain fucking angry! 
                                       MARY2
                           ROBERT2, everyone’s by the pool, go 
                           and join them. 
                                 (once he has gone)
                           I don’t think it’s kind to turn 
                           ROBERT2 against his ELEANOR1.

                           In a beauty contest between her 
                           only child and a complete stranger, 
                           my mother chose the stranger -
                                       MARY2
                           - and you’re right to feel 
                           betrayed, but ROBERT1 -
                                       PATRICK2
                           No, she lied to all of us. At every 
                           stage she told me, this is destined 
                           for Robert, this is for Thomas, for 
                           our children, but all those little 
                           concessions to family feeling are 
                           being tossed away, replaced by the 
                           trademark family malice and spite. 
                                       MARY2
                           That’s not inevitable -
                                       PATRICK2
                           Isn’t it? 
                                       MARY2
                           Not necessarily. Please - spend 
                           time with the children. That’s why 
                           we’re here.

                And now PATRICK2, bottle in hand, has thrown all that energy 
                into being an aggressively good dad. MARY follows him down to 
                the pool, where JULIA2, KETTLE, ROBERT2 and  LUCY are reading 
                quite contentedly.

                           Right. Who wants to play in the 
                           pool? ROBERT2?
                                       ROBERT2
                           I’m reading!

                           Nonsense. Let’s play, that’s why 
                           we’re here. Lucy? JULIA2? No?
                JULIA2 shakes her head and returns to her book.
        29      EXT. SWIMMING POOL, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 2003 - AFTERNOON 29
                And now they’re in the pool for a  kind of water-rugby, with 
                PATRICK2 a little too enthusiastic.
                So that when ROBERT2 has the ball, PATRICK2 grabs it too, and 
                tries to keep hold of it. There’s a tussle, light-hearted 
                enough, but when ROBERT2 wins and snatches the ball, there’s a 
                suspended moment - 
                - before PATRICK2 lunges at him a little too hard and ROBERT2 
                goes underwater. The play-fighting continues a moment too 
                long, with ROBERT2 underwater. He burst to the top, panicked, 
                reaching for the side.
                                       MARY2
                           ROBERT2!

                           He’s alright, we’re just playing -
                                       MARY2
                           It’s too much - 
                                       KETTLE
                           I knew this would happen, I could 
                           feel it - 
                                       PATRICK2
                           For Christ’s sake, Kettle -
                                       JULIA2
                           I’m sure he’s fine -
                MARY pulls him out of the pool. 
                                       PATRICK2
                           There’s nothing to see. You’re 
                           okay, aren’t you? ROBERT??
                MARY2 is there. He’s tearful, shaken, but loyal to his father -
                                       ROBERT2
                           I’m fine. Really. It’s just a game. 
      Patrick Melrose - 'Mother's Milk' - Ep 4                             19
                But PATRICK2 stands alone in the centre of the pool.
                                       PATRICK2
                           There, you see?
                Only JULIA2 gives him a sympathetic look.  
        30      INT. KITCHEN, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 2003 - EVENING          30
                A little later - dressed for the evening. PATRICK2 has snuck 
                inside. Somewhat furtively, he is shaking pills into the palm 
                of his hand. Behind him, JULIA2 is bringing in plates from 
                supper. 
                                       JULIA2
                           That looks like fun.
                                       PATRICK2
                           Not fun, a necessity I’m afraid -
                                 (he shows her the label)
                           Want one?
                                       JULIA2
                           I’ve got my own -
                                       PATRICK2
                           Of course you have -
                                       JULIA2
                           - but if you’re offering. How long?
                                       PATRICK2
                           Four years. 
                                       JULIA2
                           I thought you were only meant to 
                           take it for thirty days. 
                He shakes a pill into her hand. 
                                       PATRICK2
                           Oh, I definitely have a problem, 
                           namely it’s not strong enough. I 
                           get all the side effects, memory 
                           loss, dehydration, nightmarish 
                           withdrawals, everything except  
                           sleep.
                                 (pills between finger 
                                  and thumb)
                           Strange to think that we used to do 
                           this for fun. Remember taking acid 
                           in Greece?
                                       JULIA2
                           I remember where you stashed it.
      Patrick Melrose - 'Mother's Milk' - Ep 4                             20
                                       PATRICK2
                           Yes, sorry about that.
                                       JULIA2
                           Obviously I didn’t mind. But. Let’s 
                           not get nostalgic. 
                                       PATRICK2
                           Another pleasure denied. 
                He pours wine, to wash them down.
                                       JULIA2
                           Whenever I get nostalgic I force 
                           myself to remember what youth was 
                           actually like. 
                                       PATRICK2
                           It was awful. The trouble is, all I 
                           really remember is sex. A great 
                           abundance of sex and a sense of 
                           potential, instead of the absence 
                           of sex and a sense of waste. 
                           Christ, I’m going to need 40mg 
                           tonight.
                                       JULIA2
                           Perhaps - perhaps we shouldn’t have 
                           this conversation.
                                       PATRICK2
                           Perhaps not.
                He lifts the glass, and they swallow their pills together. 
        31      INT. THOMAS’S BEDROOM, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 2003 - NIGHT   31
                But even 40mg is not enough. In his old childhood bedroom, 
                PATRICK2’s feet stick out the bottom of the tiny bed. No hope 
                of sleep, memories crowding in. A whisper - 
                                       ELEANOR2 (V.O.)
                           Hello, my darling PATRICK2. I’m so sorry 
                           to wake you -

                DAWN
                - as we flashback to ELEANOR2, in this same room, speaking 
                soft and low -
      Patrick Melrose - 'Mother's Milk' - Ep 4                             21
                                       YOUNG PATRICK2
                           What time is it?
                                       ELEANOR2
                           It’s very early. 
                                       YOUNG PATRICK2
                           Are we going now?
                                 (ELEANOR2 nods)
                           Shall I pack my bag?
                                       ELEANOR2
                           Oh, my darling -
                                 (taking his hand)
                           I’ve got to go without you.
                                       YOUNG PATRICK2
                           You can’t -
                            ELEANOR2                 YOUNG PATRICK2 (CONT'D)                    **
                Please understand. You need      I want to come. Why can’t I?                 **
                to stay here with your                                                        *
                DAVID1, just for a short                                                      *
                while. Then when I’ve spoken                                                  *
                to the lawyers -                                                              *
                                       ELEANOR2
                           PATRICK2! Listen to me, this is 
                           important. If we’re to be together 
                           I must do this exactly right. I 
                           have to speak to the lawyers first. 
                           It won’t be long, but I must be 
                           careful, do this properly, then I 
                           can come back for you. Do you 
                           understand? PATRICK2 - do you 
                           understand?
        33      INT. THOMAS’S BEDROOM, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 2003 - NIGHT   33
                Back in the present day, PATRICK2 abandons any hope of sleep 
                in this room. He sits -
        34      INT. CORRIDOR, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 2003 - NIGHT           34
                - and walks along the corridor, heal to toe, until he reaches 
                JULIA2’s door. He pauses, reaches for the handle - 
                                       ROBERT2
                           PATRICK2.
                ROBERT2 rubs his eyes, pale and frowning.
                                       PATRICK2
                           Hello.
      Patrick Melrose - 'Mother's Milk' - Ep 4                             22
                                       ROBERT2
                           What are you doing?
                                       PATRICK2
                           Good question. Thomas has pushed me 
                           out of bed again, so I thought I’d 
                           go and sleep in his room.
                                       ROBERT2
                           But that’s JULIA1’s room. 
                                       PATRICK2
                           Yes, I wanted to check she was - 
                                 (on cue - THOMAS crying)
                           Poor Thomas, I’d better, you must - 
                           Goodnight.
                And wincing, cursing himself, he walks away.

                And now PATRICK2 stands in pyjamas and sunglasses, DAVID1 
                Melrose-style, watching the automated pool-cleaner crawl 
                round the floor of the pool. Ennui - failing as a father, 
                failing as a husband, failing as a son.
        36      EXT. BEDROOM, GATE TERRACE, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 2003 - DAY36
                Seated in her wheelchair, PATRICK2 pushes ELEANOR2 into the 
                glaring light. She shields her eyes. 
        37      EXT. TERRACE, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 2003 - DAY              37
                A long table has been laid out - JULIA2, LUCY, ROBERT2, MARY2 
                are there, CLAUDINE helping with THOMAS. PATRICK2 pushes 
                ELEANOR2 to KETTLE, aloof in dark glasses and sun hat, 
                conspicuously uninterested.
                                       PATRICK2
                           I must say, it’s like a dream, 
                           having both of you here together at 
                           the same time.
                                       ELEANOR2
                           Like a...dream. 
                                       KETTLE
                                 (indifferent)
                           My dear, so nice to see you out. 
                           How are you?
                                       ELEANOR2

                                 (crossing to MARY)
                           Well, I’ll leave you two to chat.
                The struggle continues, KETTLE’s interest visibly waning.
                                       MARY2
                           Thomas, don’t touch the wine, 
                           that’s for grown-ups.
                                       PATRICK2
                           It certainly is.
                                       MARY2
                                 (the wine -)
                           Is that the answer?
                                       PATRICK2
                           We’ll find out.
                                       MARY2
                           I’m sure we will.
                CLAUDINE leads THOMAS away to play elsewhere. 
                                       KETTLE
                           I was going to buy Thomas some 
                           child reins for his birthday but 
                           apparently they’re out of fashion.  
                                       MARY2
                           I am not putting my child in a 
                           harness!
                                       KETTLE
                           Really? Nanny used to swear by 
                           them.

                           You didn’t actually, because 
                           swearing was not allowed, unlike in 
                           some households.

                           Which one of our mothers is worst, 
                           d’you think? I realise the 
                           disinheritance-thing gives ELEANOR2 
                           the edge, but yours is certainly 
                           putting in the work -

                           Anyone who thinks a week is a long 
                           time in politics should have her to 
                           stay. A week is a fucking eternity -

                           I don’t know how you cope without a 
                           nanny.
                                       MARY2
                           I don’t know how I’d cope with one. 
                           I’ve always wanted to look after 
                           the children myself.
                                       JULIA2
                           Yes, motherhood takes some people 
                           that way. It didn’t in my case, but 
                           I was quite young when I had Lucy. 
                                 (MARY2 bites her tongue.)
                           I think you can be too nice to 
                           children. If you want them to be 
                           television producers or chief 
                           executives it’s no use filling 
                           their heads with ideas of trust and 
                           truth-telling and reliability. They 
                           won’t be able to compete in the 
                           real world.

                SEAMUS2 is approaching the house. PATRICK2 bridles, but keeps 
                quiet.

                           I was going to call by and see 
                           ELEANOR2, but here she is now.
                But KETTLE would love an escape from ELEANOR2’s company.

                           Oh, I wouldn’t want to intrude on a 
                           family affair.

                                       KETTLE
                           I’ve sometimes wondered myself 
                           about writing a book. I have so 
                           many ideas, it’s just getting them 
                           down on paper.
                SEAMUS2 is ignoring ELEANOR2 and chatting up KETTLE with the 
                full force of his charm. ELEANOR2, jilted, looks on, 
                neglected.
                                       SEAMUS2
                           I swear, it can do your head in. 
                           I’ve done the beginning, several 
                           beginnings. But then maybe it’s all 
                           beginnings, do you know what I 
                           mean?

                           She’s just doing it on purpose now, 
                           just to annoy us -

                           I must say, it all sounds 
                           absolutely fascinating.

                           PATRICK2, I’m going to do a 
                           workshop!
                                       PATRICK2
                           You should. It’s the only way 
                           you’ll see the house in the cherry 
                           season.

                           Ah, the cherries. Now they’re 
                           something. We always have a ritual 
                           around the cherries, don’t we 
                           ELEANOR2? You know, the fruits of 
                           life.

                           Sounds very profound. Do they taste 
                           better than if they were simply the 
                           fruits of the cherry tree?

                speaks quietly to her. 
                ROBERT2, meanwhile, stands abruptly and walks away. MARY2 goes 
                to follow.

                           I’m not giving you much of a 
                           holiday, am I? I’m sorry. Must try 
                           harder.

                           Is ELEANOR1 really giving this away?

                           That’s what ELEANOR1 wants to do.

                           Yes, but this is ELEANOR1, not ours. 
                           ELEANOR1’s always been pathologically 
                           generous, and if she was giving it 
                           to the blind, or the homeless, or 
                           to medical research or the victims 
                           of torture, we’d understand.

                           But ELEANOR1’s giving it to SEAMUS1.

                           Of course not, and you mustn’t 
                           either.

                           Well, this is a touching scene. 
                           MARY1 wants you back, before SEAMUS1 
                           seduces Kettle.

                           He’s trying to get MARY1 
                           disinherited too. We’ll have to 
                           kill him after all.
                                       ROBERT2
                           If we kill SEAMUS1, will we keep the 
                           house? 
                                       PATRICK2
                           Sadly not.
                                       JULIA2
                           More efficient to kill Kettle, 
                           before she changes her will.
                                       PATRICK2
                           You’re right. I let emotion cloud 
                           my judgement.
                But it’s all too much for ROBERT2 - too much malice, too 
                flirtatious. He leaves and, with some remorse, PATRICK2
                watches him go.

                           I’ve tried so hard not to pass on 
                           the malice and resentment, to give 
                           them a different sort of childhood, 
                           but they’re just fresh mistakes.

                           I thought I’d come and see you. 
                           Would you have been pleased?
                A moment, then she leans across and kisses him.
                                       JULIA2
                           Maybe next time. 
                                       PATRICK2
                           Is there going to be a next time?
                                       JULIA2
                           You’re bored and lonely, I’m bored 
                           and lonely -
                                       PATRICK2
                           That’s a terrifying amount of 
                           boredom and loneliness in one room.
                                       JULIA2
                           Maybe they’ll cancel each other 
                           out. Like electrical charges. 
                                       PATRICK2
                           We should conduct an experiment. 
                                       JULIA2
                           In controlled conditions.
                                       PATRICK2
                           See whether we eliminate boredom or 
                           achieve an overload of loneliness. 
                They kiss again.
                                       JULIA2
                           We should go back, or people will 
                           think we’re having an affair.

        40      INT. DRAWING ROOM, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 2003 - NIGHT       40
                A chair, David’s favourite. PATRICK2 stands on it, a little 
                woozy. Clamped between his teeth, like a pirate, is a 
                screwdriver, and he now attempts to unscrew an oil painting 
                from the wall. 
                MARY2 watches from the doorway.
                                       MARY2
                           I’m almost too scared to ask. 
                                       PATRICK2
                           I’m cheering myself up. These are 
                           by Boudin. Sell these and we might 
                           just be able to afford a second 
                           bedroom in Queens Park, a normal, 
                           child-sized bedroom rather than a 
                           converted broom cupboard - 
                                       MARY2
                           You can’t steal from her.
                                       PATRICK2
                           Not from her, from him. If he’s 
                           getting the house, I’m at least 
                           going to keep the fucking Boudins. 
                           Pass me that other screwdriver, 
                           will you? 
                                       MARY2
                           You can’t keep this up. At some 
                           point, you’ll have to let it all 
                           go. 
                                       PATRICK2
                           Bit late for that -
                                       MARY2
                           I don’t mean the house.
                                 (PATRICK2 doesn’t speak)
                                       MARY2 (CONT’D)
                           Do you want to come up to bed with 
                           me?
                                       PATRICK2
                           Let’s not introduce exciting words 
                           like ‘want’. We both know Thomas 
                           will be claiming my place. I’ll 
                           sleep down here. Pass me the 
                           screwdriver, will you? 
                                 (but MARY2 has already 
                                  left him)
                           Screwdriver!

        41      EXT. TERRACE, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 2003 - NIGHT            41
                PATRICK2 smokes and drinks on the terrace. Above, there’s a 
                light in JULIA1’s window.
        42      INT. CORRIDOR/JULIA1’S BEDROOM, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 2003 - 42
                NIGHT
                PATRICK pushes at the door, which is open. JULIA2 lies awake. 
                                       PATRICK2
                           Can I come in?
                He enters, and JULIA2 sits, and they kiss. After a moment -
                                       JULIA2
                           Are you alright? You seem 
                           elsewhere.
                                       PATRICK2
                           No. No, I’m here.
                And they begin to undress.
        43      INT. JULIA2’S BEDROOM, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 2003 - DAWN     43
                They lie in bed as the sun rises. That air of detachment 
                still lingers; they’re tender, but self-conscious too.
                                       PATRICK2
                           What time’s your flight?
                                       JULIA2
                           We have to leave here at nine. 
                                       PATRICK2
                           Our timing - 
                                       JULIA2
                           - has never been very good.
                They kiss.
                                       PATRICK2
                           I should go. Before Thomas wakes 
                           up. 
                                       JULIA2
                           PATRICK2. Summer fling. Yes?
                A genuine question. Neither of them quite know what this is 
                yet.
                                       PATRICK2
                           Summer fling.

        44      EXT. DRIVEWAY, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 2003 - DAY             44
                Departures. JULIA2 and LUCY are giving KETTLE a lift to the 
                airport. PATRICK2 is helping her with the bags.
                                       JULIA2
                           Well, thank you for having us. 
                                       PATRICK2
                           We’ll speak on the phone.
                                       JULIA2
                           When you get a chance.
                                       PATRICK2
                           It won’t be the same. 
                                       JULIA2
                           No. It won’t. ‘Bye. 
                 - and we see this conversation from MARY2’s P.O.V. - a 
                pointedly chaste peck on the cheek between PATRICK2 and JULIA2, 
                but MARY2 isn’t fooled. KETTLE arrives.
                                       KETTLE
                           Oh, dear. I wanted to say goodbye 
                           to SEAMUS1. Send him my love, won’t 
                           you?  It’ll be strange to be here 
                           without  you, PATRICK2. Oh - is this 
                           your  car? It’s very small... 
                MARY2 waves them all off. PATRICK2 walks away, pointedly not  
                looking back.   
                                       PATRICK2
                           Just us, thank God. Now we can have 
                           fun.
        45      EXT. SWIMMING POOL, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 2003 - DAY        45
                Smouldering cigar, black sunglasses and wine glass, PATRICK 
                sits, detached, while the children play nearby. Documents, 
                papers from the solicitors.
                MARY edits a manuscript. A tense and fragile peace.
                                       ROBERT
                           Ow! Something bit me!
                                       MARY
                           Let me see.
                                       ROBERT
                           Mosquito, right near my eye. 
      Patrick Melrose - 'Mother's Milk' - Ep 4                             32
                                       PATRICK
                           Don’t be too hard on mosquitos. 
                           Only the pregnant female whines, 
                           whereas women never stop...
                The awful remark hangs in the air. Behind his dark glasses, 
                PATRICK feels the hot flush of shame. 
                                       PATRICK (CONT’D)
                           I’m sorry, I don’t know why I said 
                           that. Here, let me help.
                And he stumbles up to play with THOMAS, but the atmosphere 
                has soured. Too drunk, too early in the day.
                                       PATRICK (CONT’D)
                           Actually, I’m going to make some 
                           coffee.
                He leaves. MARY watches, compassion fading. Growing hard.
        46      INT. KITCHEN, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 2003 - DAY              46
                In the kitchen, PATRICK spoons out coffee. His hand is 
                shaking - a new development.
                Spilt sugar - echoes of ‘Some Hope’, the nightmare of relapse 
                and recovery. 
        47      INT. OFFICE, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 2003 - DAY               47
                In the office, the fax chugs away. Legal documents to sign. 
                He eyes the phone, picks it up, dials. The murmur of an 
                answering machine.
                                       PATRICK
                           Hello. Just checking that you got 
                           back safely -
                And we switch P.O.V.’s to MARY in the hallway, watching, 
                guessing. 
                PATRICK sees her too, hangs up with his finger, changes tone.  
                                       PATRICK (CONT’D)
                           I’ll try again tomorrow. Bye.
                                 (turning to the papers)
                           Solicitors. Nearly there. 
        48      INT. BEDROOM, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 2003 - NIGHT            48
                And now MARY and PATRICK both lie rigid, tense, as the 
                electric fan clicks - click - click. 
                PATRICK gives in, gets up. MARY - wide awake.

        49      INT. DRAWING ROOM, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 2003 - NIGHT       49
                PATRICK is back on the chair, screwing the stolen Boudins 
                back into place. In dressing gown, MARY watches from the 
                doorway. 
                                       PATRICK2
                           It’s the right thing to do.
                                       MARY2
                           I’m sure it is. 
                                       PATRICK2
                           Also, they’re fakes. I spoke to a 
                           man at Sothebys. You can tell from 
                           the waves apparently. SEAMUS1 isn’t 
                           the first person to bamboozle ELEANOR1, 
                           some art dealer in Paris pulled off 
                           that facile trick thirty years ago.
                                       MARY2
                           Well, let’s not tell SEAMUS1.
                                       PATRICK2
                           Certainly not. 
                                       MARY2
                           Imagine his face when he finds out. 
                                       PATRICK2
                           ‘Dere go da flotation tanks!’
                And they laugh together - a great relief.
        50      INT. DRAWING ROOM, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 2003 - NIGHT       50
                 - and now they lie together on the sofa. Quiet, tender -
                                       PATRICK
                           I think - 
                                       MARY
                           Go on -
                                       PATRICK
                           I need to let this all go. The 
                           family’s being split in half and 
                           the only way to keep together is to 
                           drop the whole thing. 
                                       MARY
                           We couldn’t afford the upkeep 
                           anyway. Let Seamus worry about it.
                                       PATRICK

                           I know -
                                 (a deep breath)
                           But when you’ve talked about the 
                           things that happened here - won’t 
                           it help? To move on?
                                       PATRICK2
                           Perhaps. If I didn’t have my 
                           ELEANOR1’s protection, at least I had 
                           the protection of this place. Now 
                           that’s being taken away too, I feel 
                           I might go mad. At the same time, 
                           part of me can’t wait to get rid of 
                           the fucking place.

                           Then let’s go back to London.

                           Or somewhere else. After this 
                           holiday, we need a holiday.

                           Where would we go?
        51      INT. HALLWAY, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 2003 - DAY              51
                Sweating, mopping his brow, a SMARTLY-DRESSED MAN waits in 
                the doorway, briefcase in hand. 
                PATRICK greets him, shakes his hand, leads him upstairs. 
        52      INT. ELEANOR2’S BEDROOM, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 2003 - DAY    52
                - and now he produces from his briefcase an official stamp, 
                pens, documents. M. GAUTIER is the notary, here to witness 
                the signing.
                ELEANOR2 sits with a pen, the documents in front of her. MARY2 
                and CLAUDINE the nurse are also present. PATRICK2 places the 
                documents in front of her - indicates where she must sign. 
                Hands her the pen. 
                She signs. Signs again. 
                M.GAUTIER stamps the document. 
                                       PATRICK2
                           There we are. C’est fini. 
                ELEANOR2 beckons PATRICK2 closer, presses a note into PATRICK2 hand. 
                Crumpled paper. He reads the scrawl. ‘why SEAMUS1 no come’ 
                                       PATRICK2 (CONT’D)
                           I’m sure there’s a good reason.

                Later. PATRICK2 sits and reads at ELEANOR2’s side. But there’s 
                noise from the corridor. ELEANOR2 stirs, panicked. 
                                       PATRICK2
                           I’ll go and see.
        54      INT. KITCHEN, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 2003 - DAY              54
                PATRICK’s P.O.V. as he walks towards the kitchen where the 
                hippyish couple are happily making tea for themselves. KEVIN 
                and ANNETTE2, with rucksacks on their backs.
                                       KEVIN
                           Hello there! We’re back! It’s 
                           Patrick, isn’t it? Kevin, ANNETTE2 -
                                       ANNETTE2
                           We’re making tea. D’you have any 
                           fresh lemons?
                                       PATRICK2
                           I don’t understand -
                                       ANNETTE2
                           Oh. Did SEAMUS1 not talk to you? He 
                           said you might have a spare room?
        55      EXT. THE GUEST HOUSE, LACOSTE 2003 - DAY                   55
                PATRICK, furious, storms towards the Guest House, where 
                SEAMUS sits, reading in the sun. 
                                       PATRICK2
                           SEAMUS2, I don’t want to disturb 
                           your hard work - 
                                       SEAMUS2
                           Not at all. Please, here

                            - be my guest. 
                                       PATRICK2
                           Is that what I am now? Your guest? 
                           Or are you in fact our guest until 
                           we leave?

                           The terms of my ELEANOR1 gift are 
                           absolutely clear - 
                MARY2 follows on, ROBERT2 behind her.

                nothing in writing about the

                a free holiday. I have a 
                genuine sympathy for the                                                      *

                           We’re not talking about the trouble 
                           I’ve had, we’re talking about the

                                       SEAMUS2
                           They’re inseparable!

                           Everything looks inseparable to a 
                           moron!

                           Let’s all calm down, shall we?
                                       PATRICK2
                           MARY2’s your great defender, 
                           SEAMUS2. My theory is you’re a bad 
                           man pretending to be an idiot 
                           whereas she thinks you’re merely an 
                           idiot.

                           If we could stay on the subject - 
                ROBERT2 has returned and listens in, shocked by it all.

                           Perhaps the community should hold a 
                           meeting, Kevin and ANNETTE1, MARY2 
                           and yourself - 
                                       PATRICK2
                           We’re not part of your fucking

                           If you don’t want to be part of it, 
                           then perhaps you should go.

                                       MARY2
                           Well. At least we know where we 
                           stand. 
                And now ROBERT can bear it no longer.
                                       ROBERT2
                           Why don’t you go away, you horrible 
                           man, and leave us alone! This is my 
                           ELEANOR1’s house and we have 
                           more right to be here than you do!
                MARY2 takes his hand and tries to calm him down. PATRICK2 joins 
                them, a united front. Faced with this, SEAMUS2 retreats. 
                                       SEAMUS2
                           Well I’m going to have to process 
                           some of these negative feelings. 
                                       PATRICK2
                           Fine. You process away. Be my 
                           guest. Do a ritual!
                And he starts to walk away. The family head back towards the 
                house, but PATRICK2 can’t resist one more attack. He turns, 
                looking truly murderous. MARY2 watches -

                           One last thing. ELEANOR1 gave me 
                           this -
                                 (the slip of paper)
                           It’s a little shaky, she’s not 
                           well. It says ‘why SEAMUS2 no come’. 
                           Now she’s given you the house 
                           you’ve dropped her.

                           I don’t need lectures from you on 
                           the importance of my friendship 
                           with ELEANOR1.
                                       PATRICK2
                           Just go and see her. I know she’s 
                           not great company but that’s just 
                           one of the treasure trove of things 
                           you have in common.
                                       SEAMUS2
                           I don’t have to stand for these 
                           insults. You have no idea what an 
                           extraordinary woman she is.
                                       PATRICK2
                           You’re quite wrong. I couldn’t wish 
                           for a more extraordinary ELEANOR1. 
                He walks back to his family, and they walk away united, for 
                the moment at least.

                           Do you remember the olden days, 
                           when we used to go to bed in the

                           That’s not the reason. We’re not

                           For Christ’s sake, I have one hour. 
                           One hour to finish packing, find a 
                           nursing home, finish all my work, 
                           make phone calls, talk to Robert,

                           - and why do you always ask for 
                           attention when you know it’s

                           to you now.

                spot where he waited uselessly for ELEANOR2 in Never Mind.
                He walks down the corridor, stops a moment. Through the gap 
                in the door to ELEANOR2’s room -

                           Can I get you anything, or -?
                                       ELEANOR2

                           I want you...to kill me.
                PATRICK2 is speechless for a moment, then.

                           I’d love to help, but it’s against

                Looking for solace in practicality, he begins to feed her, 
                supporting her head as she takes sips from the plastic cup. 
                There’s a new, unexpected tenderness to all of this - he 
                takes great care.

                Shaken by ELEANOR2’s request, PATRICK2 approaches MARY2 and

                           What d’you think?

                           It’s exactly like I expected it to

                Curtains are pulled apart to reveal - a brick wall, a fire 
                escape. Two adjoining rooms, a fold-out sofa and TV. THOMAS, 
                now wide awake, jumps on one bed while ROBERT, exhausted, 
                flicks through the cable channels.

                           So much for the views. It’s like 
                           living in a quarry.

                           I’ll go and get something. Who

                PATRICK, carrying a brown bag of groceries, stands in front 
                of the DRAKE HOTEL - the location of his epic breakdown in

                Inside, it’s all exactly as before; money, comfort, luxury, 
                privilege. Even the sinister BELLBOY is there, along with the 
                same RECEPTIONIST.
                                       RECEPTIONIST

                He looks around, suddenly out of place, a middle-aged man 
                weighed down by groceries. The second drink is accompanied by 
                the cheque; he laughs at the price, downs the whiskey, pokes 
                in his wallet for the money.

                And now, drunk, with groceries in one hand, take-away pizzas 
                in the other, he staggers back to the room - 
        76      INT. HOTEL ROOM, THE CROWN MIDTOWN, NEW YORK 2003 - NIGHT 76
                - and bursts in with manic good cheer, into an atmosphere of 
                palpable tension. He has been gone too long, ROBERT is weepy, 
                MARY worried and angry (while THOMAS sleeps next door.)

                           with the toothpaste. 
                He ruffles ROBERT’s hair, but he shrugs this off. MARY sees 
                this, and the look of sadness it provokes. 
                Meanwhile the pizzas, leaking grease onto the carpet, are 
                hopeless and cold. 
                                       MARY

                           about that. I ordered the special,

                           We’re all exhausted. Let’s start

                                       MARY (V.O.)
                           Are you sure this is alright?
                                       PATRICK (V.O.)
                           Of course. She was very keen on the 
                           phone. We can stay as long as we 
                           want.

                And the countryside, finally pulling up at a handsome house 
                set in beautiful grounds. A man stands and waves from the 
                porch; sleek, self-satisfied, pompous but not unkind.
                                       PATRICK2
                           Oh, God. She’s invited Henry. 
                                       MARY2
                           Who’s Henry?
                                       PATRICK2
                           NANCY1’s cousin. He got all the 
                           money, which makes NANCY1 furious. 
                           Whatever you do, don’t talk about 
                           politics. He’s a nice man, but 
                           pretty much a fascist. 
                                       MARY2
                           Oh good.
                NANCY2, ELEANOR2’s younger sister, joins him, looking a little 
                less enthusiastic.

                                       MARY
                           Especially now you’re not going to 
                           become one. 
                                       PATRICK
                           Especially now.
                They get out of the car. The Melrose family suddenly feel 
                distinctly shabby.

                The tour. NANCY, brittle and self-absorbed, is wary.
                                       NANCY2
                           There’s a games room, a cinema, a 
                           pool of course -
                                       PATRICK2
                           This is very kind of you, NANCY2. 
                                       NANCY2
                           After what ELEANOR1’s done to you, 
                           it’s the least I can do. 
                                 (PATRICK1 bridles at the 
                                  tone. To MARY1)
                           PATRICK2 says that you work now!
                                       MARY2
                           Oh, I’ve always worked, I’m in 
                           publishi-

                           They won’t run indoors, will they? 
                                       MARY2
                           Of course not.

                           - shouting, that sort of thing.
                 The garden is lovely and the kids run around happily,

                           Nonsense. They must do whatever 
                           they want -

                           - but they should stay out of the 
                           woods. It’s a Lyme disease hotspot, 
                           and the ticks are just dreadful 
                           this year, the poison ivy too. It 
                           looks pretty, but really it’s like 
                           a Cambodian swamp.  Best to assume 
                           you’re always in danger.

                           ROBERT2! Thomas! Shall we go for a 
                           swim?
                                       PATRICK2
                           I’ll go get the costumes.
                                       NANCY2
                           I’ll come with you. We need to talk 
                           about ELEANOR1.

                PATRICK2 slams the car boot shut, heaves the cases inside.

                costumes.

                PATRICK sits impatiently with swimming costumes in his lap as 
                NANCY flicks furiously through an auction catalogue.
                                       NANCY2
                           So many things, so many lovely 
                           things, all stolen. A world class 
                           fortune, gone.
                                 (the catalogue)
                           These - these were ours! Made for 
                           Napoleon. They used to just sit on 
                           the terrace in the rain. A million 
                           and a half dollars, that’s what my 
                           little stepbrother got for Mummy’s 
                           garden tubs. Wouldn’t you like to 
                           have some of these for your 
                           children?
                                       PATRICK2
                           I would but it’s a little late for 
                           that now.

                           Poor Patrick. I know exactly how 
                           you must feel. 
                                       PATRICK2

                           You seem to be doing just fine 
                           here, NANCY2. 
                                       NANCY2
                           This place? Believe me, this is 
                           nothing to what we should have had -
                                       PATRICK2
                           Shall we talk about ELEANOR1?
                                 (he sits with her)
                           There’s really no improvement, or 
                           hope of improvement. ELEANOR1’s aware of 
                           this and has asked me to kill her. 
                                       NANCY2
                           Oh, PATRICK2! That’s not fair, 
                           that’s really not fair! 
                                       PATRICK2
                           I have no doubt that helping her to 
                           die would be the most loving thing 
                           I could do. 
                                       NANCY2
                           Well maybe...maybe you should rent 
                           an ambulance and drive her to 
                           Holland. 
                                       PATRICK2
                           Arriving in Holland isn’t in itself 
                           fatal. 
                                       NANCY2
                           PATRICK2, please! Let’s not talk 
                           about this any more, it’s too 
                           upsetting. 
                                       PATRICK2
                           Fine, but I haven’t told MARY1, so -

                           In case it’s a good idea.

                           Oh, I don’t drink. Didn’t you know? 
                           I watched it destroy Daddy’s life. 
                           But you help yourself.

                A little later, and PATRICK2 is sneaking away from the family 
                group, checking to see no-one has noticed. Furtive, urgent.
        87      INT. DRAWING ROOM, THE MANSION, CONNECTICUT 2003 - DAY     87
                He wears long swimming shorts, still damp, and a shirt, and 
                is searching for the drinks tray -

                           There you are!
                He goes to pour a glass of whisky then, not wanting to dirty 
                the glass, decides to take a swig from the bottle. 
                The sound of the children playing. He should join them.
                But the bottle; the level is lower than expected. 
                                       PATRICK2 (CONT’D)
                           Damn.
                Perhaps he could water it down? No water. Think!
                He takes another swig - looks around for somewhere to hide 
                the evidence -

                He hurries outside, stashing the empty bottle in a bush on 
                the way to the rental car, where he fumbles the keys, drops 
                them, climbs in. Ding-ding-ding - safety belt not on. He 
                starts the engine.

                Ding-ding-ding. Heading for the entrance, driving a little 
                too fast, the car on the left side of the road. A swerve. The 
                car on the right side of the road.

                PATRICK is driving much, much too fast. Ding-ding-ding. To 
                drown out the noise he turns the radio on. American Rock 
                Anthems. He shouts and whoops along - 
        92      EXT. CAR PARK, LIQUOR STORE, CONNECTICUT 2003 - DAY        92
                - and sprays gravel in the forecourt of the Vino Veritas 
                Liquor Store. Ding-ding-ding. He stumbles from the car and 
                runs inside.
        93      INT/EXT. CAR/CAR PARK, LIQUOR STORE, CONNECTICUT 2003 - DAY93
                Three bottles of booze in a brown paper bag are dumped onto 
                the passenger seat. Suddenly the business of driving seems 
                entirely beyond him.
                He looks at his watch, looks around him. A pay-phone.
        94      EXT. CAR PARK, LIQUOR STORE, CONNECTICUT 2003 - DAY        94
                PATRICK2 pumps coins into the phone. The murmur of JULIA1’s 
                answering machine. He pours whisky into a take-out coffee 
                cup.
                                       PATRICK2
                           JULIA1, it’s PATRICK2. Are you hiding 
                           behind your machine? Ah well.  
                The shaking hand, the slurred speech - he’s heading back to 
                the bottom. He starts to cry.
                                       PATRICK2 (CONT’D)
                           Feel a little in freefall here. I 
                           wanted a friendly voice. Ah well. I 
                           love you.

                He hangs up. What was that? Might it be true?

                He parks the rental car on the diagonal, runs up the steps -
        97      INT. DRAWING, THE MANSION, CONNECTICUT 2003 - EVENING      97
                PATRICK replaces the bottle. Gathers himself. Impossibly 
                drunk. Still wearing shorts.
        98      INT. HALLWAY, THE MANSION, CONNECTICUT 2003 - EVENING      98
                He’s buttoning up his trousers as he walks towards the dining 
                room -
        99      INT. DINING ROOM, THE MANSION, CONNECTICUT 2003 - CONTINUOUS99
                MARY, NANCY and COUSIN HENRY; sleek, self-satisfied, pompous 
                but not unkind. ROBERT sits, bored. THOMAS plays with toy 
                cars on the floor. 
                                       NANCY2
                           There you are! We were about to 
                           call the police! 
                                       PATRICK2
                           There’s a slobbering thought. I’m 
                           so sorry, I had a sudden yen to see 
                           the countryside. Sobering. Did I 
                           say slobbering?  I meant sobering. 
                He takes his seat unsteadily. This is the drunkest we’ve seen 
                him, and NANCY2 is mortified, MARY is furious. ROBERT2 is 
                frightened - he has never quite seen this state before - and 
                the air of tension is increased by THOMAS burbling away.
                                       MARY2
                           I was just saying how tired the 
                           children are from playing outside. 
                PATRICK2 winces, reaches for the wine. MARY2 - ‘don’t.’
                                       NANCY2
                           Of course it’s nothing to what we 
                           used to have. My grandfather had a 
                           150-acre garden on Long Island. I’m 
                           not talking about the woods and 
                           fields, a garden -
      Patrick Melrose - 'Mother's Milk' - Ep 4                             51
                                       PATRICK2
                           Shall we change the subject? 
                NANCY is stung. 
                                       MARY2
                           Henry has been telling us all bout 
                           the Middle East. 
                                       PATRICK2
                            - or we could change it back.
                                       COUSIN HENRY
                           I was recalling Pearl Harbour. When 
                           Admiral Yamamoto had finished his 
                           attack, he said ‘Gentlemen, we have 
                           roused a sleeping giant - ’
                And during the above, PATRICK2 reaches for the wine. MARY2 
                touches his hand - no, please no more - but he pours it all 
                the same, and all the while THOMAS’s noise gets louder. 
                                       COUSIN HENRY (CONT’D)
                           ...and it is this thought that 
                           should be in the mind of the 
                           world’s terrorists and their state 
                           sponsors.
                                       NANCY2
                           Are you familiar with the phrase 
                           ‘children should be seen not 
                           heard?’
                A beat, then MARY2 bridles.
                                       MARY2
                           Of course. I think it’s nonsense.
                                       NANCY2
                           For my part, I’ve always thought it 
                           was entirely too liberal. 
                                       MARY2
                                 (laughing, appalled)
                           You’d rather not see him either? 
                           Fine.
                MARY2 stands and takes ROBERT2 and THOMAS to the door. ROBERT2 
                is visibly upset at his father’s state.
                                       PATRICK
                           Christ, NANCY2, you sound just like 
                           DAVID1.
                                       NANCY2
                           PATRICK2, we’re just trying to 
                           extend some hospitality -

                           Oh we just po’ white trash, 
                           throwing oursef on the charitee of 
                           our American kin.
                                       HENRY
                           You don’t have to accept it, if you 
                           don’t want to.
                                       PATRICK2
                           You’re right, we don’t. 
                MARY stands in the doorway. ‘Not again...’
                                       MARY2
                           But we’d like to.
                                       PATRICK2
                           Speak for yourself.
                                       MARY2
                           I am! And I’m also trying to speak 
                           for our children.
                                       PATRICK2
                           You’re not even speaking for 
                           yourself! ‘Entirely too liberal!’? 
                           I mean, fuck off!
        100     INT. BEDROOM, THE MANSION, CONNECTICUT 2003 - NIGHT       100
                Later. MARY packs their suitcases while PATRICK, a little 
                more sober and ashamed now, stands in the doorway.
                                       MARY2
                           Less than twenty-four hours.
                                       PATRICK2
                           A new personal best.
                                       MARY2
                           Hardly worth unpacking. 
                                       PATRICK2
                                 (THOMAS on the bed)
                           You’re safely installed with your 
                           lover, I see.
                                       MARY2
                           I’ll move him to one side.

                one drop, one tiny drop of       voice -                                      *
                love and affection escape 
                from the children - 
      Patrick Melrose - 'Mother's Milk' - Ep 4                             53
                                       MARY2 (CONT’D)
                           You’re right! I’ve no love or 
                           affection when you’re like this. 
                                       PATRICK2
                           And the rest of the time? 
                                       MARY2
                                 (she laughs)
                           The ‘rest of the time’? 
                She sits. Quietly, calmly - THOMAS is right there.
                                       MARY2 (CONT'D)
                           I think you ought to know; I’ve 
                           started to imagine life without 
                           you PATRICK2. Any compassion or patience I 
                           might have had, it’s all dried up - 
                           and it’s not just the drinking, or 
                           this demeaning...thing with JULIA1 - 
                           demeaning to you as much as me - or 
                           the mindless destruction. It’s the 
                           way the children are involved. That 
                           thing NANCY1 said, about watching 
                           her father destroy his life. It’s 
                           what ROBERT1 saw this evening -
                                 (PATRICK2 knows this too)
                           - and yet you don’t stop. If you 
                           can’t change, you have to go. 
                                       PATRICK2
                           I see. Would you like me to go now?
                                       MARY2
                           Yes, please. 
                                 (goes back to packing)
                           At least there are plenty of spare 
                           bedrooms. 
        101     INT/EXT. CAR/DRIVEWAY, THE MANSION, CONNECTICUT 2003 - DAY101
                The rental car is driving away. No-one waves goodbye. Inside, 
                a barely suppressed atmosphere of anger and embarrassment -
        102     INT/EXT. CAR/BACK ROADS, CONNECTICUT 2003 - DAY           102
                Heading back to New York. PATRICK2 checks behind - the kids 
                aren’t listening. In a low voice -  
                                       PATRICK2
                           I didn’t want to tell you while we 
                           were on holiday. And it’s not an 
                           excuse. ELEANOR1 has asked me to 
                           kill her. To help her die.
      Patrick Melrose - 'Mother's Milk' - Ep 4                             54
                                       MARY2
                           I see. I’m sorry.
                                 (she takes this in)
                           God.
                And they drive on in silence.

                And wearily, once again unload their bags outside the hotel - 
        104     INT. CORRIDOR, THE CROWN MIDTOWN, NEW YORK 2003 - DAY     104
                - and head down an identical corridor to their room. 
        105     INT. HOTEL ROOM, THE CROWN MIDTOWN, NEW YORK 2003 - NIGHT105
                Grocery bags, take-out cartons. THOMAS already asleep under 
                the sheets. ROBERT looks through the door at his father, 
                lying on the floor in front of the sofa bed, channel hopping. 
                MARY watches too, the news about ELEANOR still with her. Not 
                forgiveness exactly, but a sense of understanding. Quietly - 
                                       MARY2
                           Why don’t you go and sit with your 
                           PATRICK2. Watch TV. He’d like that.
                ROBERT2’s about to approach, but now PATRICK2 opens a miniature 
                of whisky, pours it, knocks back a pill, then becomes aware 
                of ROBERT’s presence. He shows the tiny bottle to ROBERT.
                                       PATRICK2
                           I’m cutting down.
                                 (He tries a smile. 
                                  ROBERT2 smiles back. 
                                  With open arms)
                           Come and say goodnight.
                                       ROBERT2
                                 (remaining in the 
                                  doorway)
                           Goodnight then.
                And ROBERT closes the door. PATRICK watches, and remembers - 
        105A    INT. HALLWAY, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 1967 - NIGHT          105A
                - YOUNG PATRICK walking down the corridor, late at night, 
                pushing at his mother’s door - 
      Patrick Melrose - 'Mother's Milk' - Ep 4                             55
        105B    INT. ELEANOR’S ROOM, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 1967 - CONTINUOUS105B
                - ELEANOR is awake. She sees YOUNG PATRICK and smiles, throws 
                back the sheet. He climbs in and she pulls him close. 
        106     INT. HOTEL ROOM, THE CROWN MIDTOWN, NEW YORK 2003 - NIGHT106
                Lying on the floor, PATRICK hears the laughter through the 
                walls.
                He turns on the TV, turns the volume up. Channel hops, the 
                channels changing faster, faster -
                CUT TO BLACK.

                CHAMPAGNE! Put on ice in preparation for a PARTY in a high, 
                bright room.
                Trays of canapes are laid out by CATERERS, white tablecloths 
                are thrown over trestle tables, glasses are polished. 
        2       INT. BATHROOM, WEST LONDON 2005 - DAY                       2
                April 2005. PATRICK MELROSE, now in his mid-40s, wipes steam 
                from the bathroom mirror. In C.U., older, trimmer, he shaves 
                carefully. 
                A dark suit hangs, waiting. PATRICK pulls on a crisp white 
                shirt, inserts cuff-links, slips into polished shoes.
        3       INT. ONSLOW CLUB, WEST LONDON 2005 - DAY                    3
                Flowers are arranged, white lilies and roses, by a WAITRESS - 
                we’ll know her later as HELENE. Elsewhere, two WAITERS carry 
                a large, wrapped canvas to an easel at the end of the room, 
                ready for unveiling.
        4       INT. BATHROOM, WEST LONDON 2005 - DAY                       4
                MARY MELROSE is getting ready too - putting in ear-rings, 
                applying lipstick. Upbeat MUSIC continues.
        5       INT. BEDROOM, WEST LONDON 2005 - DAY                        5
                A plastic bag full of tangled neckties. PATRICK rejects 
                stripes, spots, blue and green and settles on black.
        6       INT. HALLWAY, WEST LONDON 2005 - DAY                        6
                MARY, about to leave, inspects her reflection, tugs at the 
                hem of her little black dress - too little? Right for this 
                particular occasion?
                She peers at the lipstick. What on earth was she thinking? 
                She produces a tissue, wipes it away.

        7       INT. BEDSIT, WEST LONDON 2005 - DAY                         7
                PATRICK, in black tie and suit, sits at the table. For the 
                first time, a clear view of the setting - a bedsit, sparsely 
                furnished, very much not the family home. Life alone.
                In his hand, a fountain pen and a small pile of white index 
                cards. He stares hard at the card, pen poised, ready to 
                write.
        8       INT. BUNYON’S FUNERAL PARLOUR, LONDON 2005 - DAY            8
                In C.U., an artificial white silk rose is held between the 
                twisted fingers of ELEANOR MELROSE. Another hand, latex-
                gloved, removes the rose and puts it to one side to use 
                again.
                ELEANOR’s face, revealed now, is hollow-cheeked, pale and 
                dusted with powder. Lifeless. One last glimpse - 
                - and the COFFIN LID slides into place. 
        9       INT. ONSLOW CLUB, WEST LONDON 2005 - DAY                    9
                The brown paper is pulled from the canvas, revealing a huge 
                black and white photo of ELEANOR in her ‘Sixties pomp, arms 
                outstretched in a gesture of welcome, of generosity, a 
                champagne glass in hand, presiding over this, her final 
                party.  
                ‘In loving memory of Eleanor Melrose, 1931 to 2005’ 
        10      INT. BEDSIT, WEST LONDON 2005 - DAY                        10
                PATRICK stares hard at the whiteness, pen poised, ready to 
                write.
                But nothing comes. On the blank card, he writes - 
                                              ‘?’
        11      INT. MORTLAKE CREMATORIUM, WEST LONDON 2005 - DAY          11
                - PATRICK stands sentry at the side of his mother’s coffin at 
                the crematorium, one hand on the coffin’s lid. A moment of 
                solitude.

                goodbye in Lacoste. Silence, then -

                PATRICK2, in his barrister’s gowns, is speaking on the pay

                                     SWISS VOICE
                           It’s really not a matter of 
                           euthanasia. It’s an assisted 
                           suicide administered by the patient 
                           herself. We’d need a letter of 
                           consent.
                                     PATRICK2
                           She can’t write. She certainly 
                           couldn’t give herself an injection -

                           Yes.

                           Can she swallow?

                           Then maybe we can help. But we’d 
                           need a doctor’s report too.
        14      INT. CORRIDOR, ELEANOR2’S NURSING HOME 2004 - DAY           14
                ELEANOR2, very frail now, is turned in her bed. It’s physical, 
                distressing.  In the corridor, DOCTOR FENELON, the Melrose 
                family doctor, visiting as requested, debates with an anxious 
                and frustrated PATRICK2.
                                     DOCTOR FENELON
                           Suicide stems from a disease, a 
                           disease we now call depression, and 
                           that’s what we should be treating.
                                     PATRICK2
                           She can’t move or speak or control 
                           herself. Depression isn’t a

                           reasonable response. Frankly it’s 
                           cheerfulness that would take some 
                           explaining.

                           ELEANOR2’s on them! They gave a certain 
                           enthusiasm to her loathing of life. 
                           That’s when she asked me to kill 
                           her.

                           It can be a great privilege to work 
                           with the dying. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           I don’t think she’s going to start 
                           working with the dying, do you? If 
                           you mean that it’s a great 
                           privilege for you, I’m more 
                           concerned with her quality of life.

                to ‘celebrate the life!’: ‘There 
                goes the school tart. They say he 
                had a good war, but I know better!’

                made-up. I suppose your aunt will 
                be here soon, an all too familiar 
                face amidst the Aubergines, her 
                vibrant self-pity masquerading as 
                grief -

                Try not to be bitter about the 
                money. One or two of my friends 
                who’ve made a mess of that side of 
                things have ended up dying in 
                National Health wards, and I must 
                say I’ve been very impressed by the 
                humanity of the mainly foreign 
                staff.

                           I think I’m entitled to feel a 
                           little ambiguous, don’t you?
                She stands next to him.
                                     PATRICK2 (CONT’D)
                           She asked me to arrange it, get the 
                           doctor, the letter of consent - 
                                     MARY2
                           I know.

                           - manipulated me, turned her death 
                           into this passion project, and now 
                           ELEANOR1 changes her mind.
                                     MARY2
                           She’s frightened. ELEANOR1 doesn’t want 
                           to do it herself, ELEANOR1 wants someone 
                           to do it for her -
                                     PATRICK2
                           Oh believe me, I’m sorely tempted.

                           place? They’d make a fortune.
                                     MARY2
                           Come and talk to her.
                                     PATRICK2
                           What’s the point? If ELEANOR1’d ever had 
                           anything meaningful to say to me, 
                           it’s too late now. 
                                     MARY2
                           Nevertheless. You mustn’t run away.
        21      INT. MORTLAKE CREMATORIUM, WEST LONDON 2005 - DAY          21
                In the PRESENT, SEAMUS’s sidekick, oozes compassion and 
                concern.
                                     ANNETTE2
                           Were you thinking about ELEANOR2?
                               (he turns)
                           ANNETTE2, we met in France, d’you 
                           remember?
    Patrick Melrose - 'At Last'- Ep 5       11
                      PATRICK2
                Yes, I hope you’re enjoying my 
                family home.
                      ANNETTE2
                Oh, we are! SEAMUS sends his love. 
                He’s in your old bedroom now! He 
                wanted to be here but he’s still 
                writing his book! How are you 
                taking all this? You know Maya 
                Angelou says that the meaning of 
                our lives is the impact we have on 
                other people, whether we make them 
                feel good or not. ELEANOR1 always 
                made people feel good. 
                      PATRICK2
                I might use that in my speech.
                      ANNETTE2
                You should! My gift to you!
                      PATRICK2
                You know who loves Maya Angelou? 
                The old man over there, with the 
                stick. Do tell him. His name’s 
                NICHOLAS1.
                      ANNETTE2
                Will do!
                  (crossing to NICHOLAS2)
                Hello, you must be NICHOLAS2...
          And now NANCY2, ELEANOR1’s sister, arrives, exhausted and 
          clearly appalled by the other mourners. She kisses him 
          peremptorily on the cheek.
                      NANCY2
                Patrick, of all the days to have 
                the funeral! It’s Prince Charles’ 
                wedding!
                      PATRICK2
                I’m sure you’d be there if you’d 
                been invited.
                      NANCY2
                But everyone’s at Windsor!
          PATRICK2 notices that JOHNNY2 has arrived.
                      PATRICK2
                Feel free to nip down with a 
                cardboard periscope and a Union 
                Jack if you think it would be more 
                entertaining - 
    Patrick Melrose - 'At Last'- Ep 5       12
          With some relief, he crosses to JOHNNY2 - an embrace, and 
          they’re into their routine.
                      JOHNNY2
                Lovely venue. 
                      PATRICK2
                Yes, I might get cremated here 
                myself. 
                      JOHNNY2
                No need to rush.
                      PATRICK2
                I was planning to wait until I die.
                      JOHNNY2
                How are you bearing up? 
                      PATRICK2
                Weirdly elated. I think my mother’s 
                death could be the best thing to 
                happen to me since, well, my 
                father’s death. 
                      JOHNNY2
                I’m sure it’s a little more 
                complicated than that.
                      PATRICK2
                You’re the psychiatrist -
                      JOHNNY2
                Psychotherapist. 
                      PATRICK2
                Whatever.
          From elsewhere, a raised voice - 
                      NICHOLAS2
                What utter, utter nonsense -
                      JOHNNY2
                Christ, NICHOLAS2 Pratt, I didn’t 
                expect to see him.
                      PATRICK2
                You’re so lucky to have an ethical 
                reason not to talk to him.
                      JOHNNY2
                Doesn’t everyone?
          Over to NICHOLAS2, joined by NANCY2
    Patrick Melrose - 'At Last'- Ep 5       13
                      NICHOLAS2
                Stand by the furnace, or the grave 
                side, and repeat these words. 
                “Goodbye, old thing. One of us was 
                bound to die first and I’m 
                delighted it was you!’ That’s my 
                spiritual practice and you’re 
                welcome to put it in your hilarious 
                ‘spiritual tool box.’
                      ANNETTE2
                  (to NANCY2)
                Isn’t he hysterical! What he 
                doesn’t realise is that we live in 
                a loving universe, and it loves you 
                too, NICHOLAS2!
                      NICHOLAS2
                  (escaping)
                My dear, I never thought I’d be so 
                pleased to see you!
                      NANCY2
                NICHOLAS, who are these peculiar 
                people? Why are they here?
          As they survey the room, JULIA2 arrives. PATRICK2 sees her. 
          JOHNNY2 squeezes his arm - ‘good luck’ - and he crosses.
                      NICHOLAS2
                Zealots, moonies, witch doctors. 
                Avoid eye contact, stick close to 
                me and we may live to tell the 
                tale.
                      NANCY2
                  (on JOHNNY2, alone now)
                And who is he?
                      NICHOLAS2
                He wouldn’t be anyone at all if he 
                wasn’t my daughter’s psychoanalyst. 
                As it is, he’s a fiend.
          MARY2, greeting guests, has noticed JULIA2 too and watches as 
          PATRICK2 hurries over, intercepted on the way by the FUNERAL 
          DIRECTOR.
                      FUNERAL DIRECTOR
                We can start when you’re ready, 
                sir.
                      PATRICK2
                Ten minutes.
                      FUNERAL DIRECTOR
                  (panicked)
                Ten minutes?
    Patrick Melrose - 'At Last'- Ep 5       14
                      PATRICK2
                There are still people arriving!
                  (with JULIA2, a kiss 
                   through her veil)
                Just in time. We’re about to kick 
                off, if that’s the phrase I was 
                looking for.
                      JULIA2
                It’s not.
                      PATRICK2
                It’s been a while.
                      JULIA2
                Almost a year. Is it true you’ve 
                given up drinking again? 
                      PATRICK2
                Yes, that’s all over.
                      JULIA2
                Congratulations. It must be hard 
                just now.
                      PATRICK2
                Not at all. A crisis demands a 
                hero. The ambush comes when things 
                are going well. Or so I’m told. 
                      JULIA2
                Still not given-up irony then.
                      PATRICK2
                Hardest addiction of all. Forget 
                heroin, that need to mean two 
                things at once -
                      JULIA2
                I’m having enough trouble wearing 
                nicotine patches and smoking at the 
                same time. Don’t take my irony, 
                leave me with a little sarcasm! 
                      PATRICK2
                Sarcasm doesn’t count. It only 
                means one thing. 
                      JULIA2
                Quality freak. 
          The FUNERAL DIRECTOR loiters nervously.
                      PATRICK2
                The corpses are piling up outside, 
                you’d better take a seat. 
      Patrick Melrose - 'At Last'- Ep 5                                   15
                                     JULIA2
                           Very exciting. Who’s on the bill?
                                     PATRICK2
                           I’ve no idea. MARY1 organised it. 
                                     JULIA2
                           Sweet. 
                                     PATRICK2
                               (about to react, but -)
                           We’ll talk more.
                She puts her hand on his arm, kisses him.
                                     JULIA2
                           It’s good to see you again. I 
                           wasn’t sure I would.
        22      INT. PATRICK’S BEDSIT, WEST LONDON 2004 - DAY              22
                FLASHBACK. PATRICK and JULIA lie on a bare mattress after 
                unsuccessful love-making. Clothes dishevelled, both smoking, 
                staring at the yellowing ceiling. 
                PATRICK2 is in the process of moving into his depressing 
                bedsit. Suitcases are still unpacked, whisky bottles and 
                ashtrays litter the floor. He’s at the height of his 
                alcoholism here.
                                     JULIA2
                           You’re not really going to live 
                           here, are you?
                                     PATRICK2
                           I’m trying to think of it as my 
                           ‘bachelor pad.’ 
                                     JULIA2
                           Hm. It’s the kind of place people 
                           come to kill themselves.
                                     PATRICK2
                           The thought had -
                                     JULIA2
                           Be serious. Surely Mother Mary will 
                           take you back. What have you told 
                           the boys?
                                     PATRICK2
                               (pouring a drink)
                           I’m ‘away on business.’
                                     JULIA2
                           Christ, it’s all so bleak.
                               (the drink)

      Patrick Melrose - 'At Last'- Ep 5                                   16
                                     JULIA2 (CONT'D)
                           Well, I’m sorry, squalor’s not an 
                           aphrodisiac, not at our age. I 
                           can’t come here again.
                                     PATRICK2
                           No, I don’t think you should.
                A moment. Then - 
                                     JULIA2
                           I see.
                               (grinds out her cigarette)
                           It wasn’t anything after all. Now 
                           that you’re not with Mary, you 
                           don’t need me. I was...structural.
                                     PATRICK
                           Exactly.
                And JULIA sits, straightens her clothing, picks up her things 
                and, without turning back, leaves. PATRICK reaches for his 
                glass - 
        23      EXT. MELROSE FAMILY HOME, WEST LONDON 2004 - DAY           23
                - and, drunk, stands outside the old family home. He knocks 
                on the door. No reply. He lets himself in - 
        24      INT. LIVING ROOM, MELROSE FAMILY HOME, WEST LONDON 2004 - DAY24
                Clumsy, belligerent, PATRICK2 is pulling books from the 
                shelves. He is very drunk, and doesn’t notice ROBERT1, in 
                school uniform, watching from the doorway.
                                     MARY2 (O.S.)
                           ROBERT2? What are you doing in 
                           there?
                                     PATRICK2
                               (noticing ROBERT2)
                           Hello, I didn’t hear you. Come 
                           here!
                Now MARY2 is there. 
                                     MARY2
                           What’s going on?

                           I’m picking up some things. 
                                     MARY2
                           ROBERT2, take Thomas upstairs 
                           please.

                other. Hello, ROBERT2. How’s                                           *
                school? Where’s Thomas?                                               *
                There’s one last look between PATRICK2 and ROBERT2, tears 
                starting to form in his eldest son’s eyes.
                                     PATRICK2
                           I’ll come up and say goodbye!
                               (ROBERT2 leaves)
                           Just a few bits and pieces, if 
                           that’s alright. A few heirlooms to 
                           brighten up the bachelor pad -

                           Fine, take what you want, go back 
                           to your flat, pass out there, but I 
                           don’t want the children to see you 
                           in this state.

                           Oops! Don’t worry about that lamp, 
                           I’ll buy you a new one.
                                     MARY2
                           Leave it and go home!
                                     PATRICK2
                           Home! How sweet of you to think of 
                           it as my home! I’m not in that 
                           happy position -
                And finally MARY2 can’t bear it.
                                     MARY2
                           Christ, this is hell, it’s like 
                           being in hell. You, you of all 
                           people, should know...this is 
                           intolerable! You know? ‘The service 
                           is intolerable, the noise is 
                           intolerable’ Well, this is fucking 
                           intolerable. I am not ELEANOR1 and I 
                           will not stand by and watch the 
                           disgusting, pitiful spectacle of 
                           you destroying yourself, and I 
                           certainly won’t let the boys watch 
                           it either. It’s too much and it’s 
                           gone on for too long.

                           If you really are determined to

                           have a room to do it in.
                And she goes, leaving PATRICK2 on the floor.
        27      INT. HALLWAY, BEDSIT, WEST LONDON 2004 - NIGHT             27
                The communal hallway is bleak and depressing, the timed light 
                switch clicking off as he struggles to fit his key in the 
                lock. 
        28      INT. BEDSIT, WEST LONDON 2004 - NIGHT                      28
                The place looks even bleaker now, impossible to bear. A 
                decision.
                From the kitchen, a bottle of whisky. Methodical and 
                strangely calm, PATRICK starts to drink -
        29      INT. BEDSIT, WEST LONDON 2004 - DAY                        29
                - and wakes up the next morning, PATRICK lying in the debris 
                of bottles and ashtrays, barely alive.
                The phone rings. Answering it is inconceivable - he is still 
                drunk - so he lies and listens.
                                     MARY ON ANSWERING MACHINE
                               (tired, anxious)
                           Hello. Pick-up if you can.
                               (a pause, a sigh)
                           Hope you’re okay. The boys asked 
                           about you. We’ll talk, but do know - 
                           we do love you.
                She hangs up. He pulls the phone towards him, dials a number.  
                                     PATRICK
                           Hello, directory enquiries please. 
        30      EXT/INT. MINICAB, WEST LONDON 2004 - DAY                   30
                A profoundly sick PATRICK collapses into the back of a 
                minicab, clothes stuffed in plastic bags. 
        31      INT/EXT. MINICAB, ROAD 2004 - DAY                          31
                The cab heads west out of the city - 
      Patrick Melrose - 'At Last'- Ep 5                                   19
                - then on into countryside. PATRICK, exhausted and pale, 
                sleeps with his head against the window. His hands are 
                shaking, sweat is pouring from him - more than a hangover.
        32      INT/EXT. MINICAB/COUNTRY HOUSE 2004 - DAY                  32
                The taxi pulls up. PATRICK stuffs notes into the DRIVER’s 
                hand and gets out. 
                A large, rather grand COUNTRY HOUSE. PATRICK regards it 
                warily, then picks up his bag and stumbles towards it.
                                     HENRY (O.S.)
                           Nobody communicates in this family! 
        33      INT. MORTLAKE CREMATORIUM, LONDON 2005 - DAY               33
                THE PRESENT, and HENRY, PATRICK’s avuncular, wealthy cousin 
                from Mother’s Milk has arrived. He shakes PATRICK’s hand 
                warmly -
                                     HENRY
                           - I was staying at the Connaught 
                           and when they wheeled in The Times 
                           with my breakfast, I saw that your 
                           mother had died!
                                     PATRICK
                           I’m sorry, the last time we spoke 
                           was at Nancy’s. I’m afraid I was a 
                           bit of a nightmare. 
                                     HENRY
                           Well, I guess no-one enjoys being 
                           unhappy. It tends to spill over. 
                                     PATRICK
                           It does, but I’m glad you made it.
                                     HENRY
                           I loved your mother very much. She 
                           had an innocent quality that drew 
                           you in and kept you distant at the 
                           same time. 
                                     PATRICK
                           At least part of that is very true.
                                     HENRY
                           Well whatever you feel about her, 
                           you know she was a good woman with 
                           the best intentions. 
                He places a hand on PATRICK’s shoulder.

                He goes. PATRICK stands for a moment, pondering that word 
                ‘innocent’. He’s watched by MARY. He sees her, smiles - 
                A Bach chorale calls people to their seats. We stay on MARY. 
        34      EXT. GARDEN, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 1997 - DAY               34
                FLASHBACK. MARY2 is PREGNANT with THOMAS. PATRICK2 is playing 
                happily with ROBERT2 (precise date here depends on YOUNG 
                ROBERT2’s age, but some time around 1997). A happier time in 
                the marriage, with PATRICK2 still sober. 
                Pre-Transpersonal Foundation days. ELEANOR2 is relatively 
                healthy - no stroke yet - and coherent, attempting, somewhat 
                awkwardly, to confide.
                                     ELEANOR2
                           I think my problem is that I can 
                           never forget he’s DAVID1’s son.
                                     MARY2
                           Does he remind you of DAVID1m?
                                     ELEANOR2
                           Flashes, when PATRICK2’s angry or 
                           sarcastic. Which thankfully is less 
                           often now.
                               (a moment, a breath)
                           Does PATRICK2 talk to you about DAVID1?
                                     MARY2
                           I don’t think he haunts him the way 
                           he once did.
                                     ELEANOR2
                           ‘Haunts’
                PATRICK2 charges across the lawn, ROBERT2 laughing on his back.
                                     ELEANOR2 (CONT’D)
                           But you are alright?
                                     MARY2
                           Hm?
                                     ELEANOR2
                           He treats you well? And the 
                           children?
                                     MARY2
                           Of course. He’s not his father.

                           Can I show you something? In 
                           private. 
        35      INT. DINING ROOM, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 1997 - DAY          35
                The room is gloomy after the afternoon sunlight. ELEANOR 
                wrings her hands in anxiety as MARY2 reads a letter, shocked, 
                disquieted.
                                     ELEANOR2
                           It came last week. I get an awful 
                           lot of letters, usually people 
                           asking for a helping hand, and I 
                           give it if I can, but this is 
                           something different. 
                                     MARY2
                           She seems deeply damaged.
                                     ELEANOR2
                           Clearly she’s a very unhappy woman, 
                           the alcohol, the depression, but 
                           really - to lay this at my door - 
                                     MARY2
                           Do you remember her?
                                     ELEANOR2
                           Of course! The family were 
                           charming. She was a bright, happy 
                           little girl. DAVID1 could be harsh, 
                           but the children were always safe, 
                           DAVID1 was better with children, 
                           playful even, so long as they 
                           weren’t too noisy.
                MARY2’s anger is tangible - 
                                     ELEANOR2 (CONT’D)
                           All I know is that family seemed 
                           perfectly happy. They told me 
                           they’d had a lovely time.
                                     MARY2
                           She says your DAVID1 interfered 
                           with her.
                                     ELEANOR2
                           But how could he?! It was 
                           inconceivable, literally, I could 
                           not conceive of such things - 
                                     MARY2
                           No suspicion -

                           No signs -
                                     ELEANOR2
                           None at all. That’s what makes me 
                           so angry ’I forgive you’. She 
                           forgives me for not protecting her, 
                           but how could? From what? I didn’t 
                           even know this kind of... behaviour 
                           existed?
                MARY2 can’t bear this. She stands. Outside, PATRICK2 and ROBERT2 
                are playing. MARY2 watches from the window as they walk 
                towards the house.
                                     ELEANOR2 (CONT’D)
                           You mustn’t say a word about this.

                                     ELEANOR2
                           It will only unsettle him, all this 
                           talk of blame and forgiveness. 
                           Goodness, I know what a tyrant his 
                           father could be, but I did my best. 
                           Always my very, very best to 
                           protect PATRICK2.

                                     ELEANOR2
                           I did.
                                     MARY2
                           Yes, you did. Eventually.
                                     ELEANOR2
                           PATRICK2 was always safe. Always. 
                           I’m sure of it.

                MARY2, shaken by the conversation, walks numbly down the 
                corridor. Piano continues off-screen. She turns into her 
                bedroom.

                           The things you told me, when we 
                           met. About DAVID1 - 
                                     PATRICK2
                           What’s brought this on?
                                     MARY2
                           We have to talk about it again. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           I’ve really nothing more to add -
                                     MARY2
                           I think you should tell your 
                           ELEANOR1.
                               (PATRICK2 groans)
                           I’m sorry, I know you don’t want 
                           to, I know it’s hard -
                                     PATRICK2
                           Why then?
                                     MARY2 
                           Because...she can’t keep hiding.

                In the PRESENT DAY, MARY sits at the front, eyes blurred; the 
                photo of Eleanor on the order of service. She’s joined by 
                PATRICK, full of manic, nervous energy. 
                                     PATRICK
                           It’s show-time -
                               (the red eyes)
                           Are you alright?
                                     MARY
                           Yes, yes, just thinking about your 
                           mother.

                           A highly suitable choice, madam. 
                A moment and then they start to giggle. The ceremony begins, 
                BACH replaced by ‘I Got Plenty of Nuthin’’, this time the 
                version by Paul Robeson, scratchy and more sombre.

    Patrick Melrose - 'At Last'- Ep 5       24
                      NANCY
                When I think of how we were brought 
                up, to end up in a crematorium in 
                Mortlake. All the lovely things, 
                all the lovely houses, where have 
                they all gone?
                      NICHOLAS
                Presumably they’re where they’ve 
                always been, but they’re being 
                lived in by people who can afford 
                them.
                      NANCY
                But that’s just it, I should be 
                able to afford them. And to be 
                cremated too; fire is something one 
                dreads.
                      NICHOLAS
                If you ask me, the Egyptians got it 
                right with the Pyramids. 
                      NANCY
                Yes! Something huge and permanent 
                with all one’s things, lots and 
                lots of things, tucked inside. 
          ANNETTE2 from the Foundation steps up to the lectern. 
                      NICHOLAS2
                Oh, Christ. It’s the Spiritual Tool 
                Box -
                      ANNETTE2
                  (As the MUSIC stops)
                What a great choice for ELEANOR1! A 
                fitting reminder, too, of her 
                incredibly strong connection with 
                the African-American people.
          PATRICK2 and MARY2 are giggling now, MARY2 squeezing his arm. 
                      ANNETTE2 (CONT’D)
                All of you will have known ELEANOR1 
                in different ways and if my ELEANOR1 
                is not yours, all I will say 
                is...let her in. Let her in.
                  (more giggles)
                I first met ELEANOR1 when a group of us 
                from the Dublin Women’s Healing 
                Drum Circle went down to her 
                wonderful house in Provence which 
                many of you know well -

                           When we arrived we saw her sitting 
                           on the wall of the terrace, hands 
                           tucked under her thighs, for all 
                           the world like a lonely young 
                           child, dreaming about the future... 
        39      INT. BUNYON’S FUNERAL PARLOUR, LONDON 2005 - NIGHT         39
                FLASHBACK to five days before. PATRICK2 is alone with his 
                ELEANOR2’s remains in the subterranean chapel.
                                     ANNETTE2 (V.O.)
                           Soon she’d flung her arms wide to 
                           greet us, but I never lost that 
                           first impression of her child-like 
                           quality - 
                The room is plain, more functional than the New York chapel 
                of rest. With trepidation, he steps closer like a man 
                approaching a cliff edge.
                                     ANNETTE2 (V.O.)
                           - her belief that justice could be 
                           achieved and that there was 
                           goodness in every person and every 
                           situation, no matter how hidden it 
                           might seem at first sight. 
                She is holding the satin rose that we saw in the opening 
                sequence. He leans over and touches her chest, startled at 
                its thinness. He kisses her forehead, noting its coldness. 
                There’s none of the rage and malice that he felt in 
                confronting his father’s corpse in ‘Bad News’. It’s sad, more 
                tender.

                           Not sure. A little longer, please?
                Something gnawing -

                FLASHBACK. PATRICK is wheeled on a trolley, drips of saline 
                attached. The stately home is a REHAB CLINIC, and PATRICK is 
                an emergency admission, dressed in plain hospital clothing, 
                hastily-packed bag on his lap. White-faced, shaking 
                uncontrollably. Even in his junkie days, he wasn’t as unwell 
                as this.

                                     DOCTOR PAGAZZI
                           You’re undergoing delirium tremens. 
                           Do you know what that is, Mr. 
                           Melrose?

                           Then you’ll know what to expect. 
                           Shaking, sweating, there may be 
                           some hallucinations. We’ll get you 
                           something to stabilise your heart,

                                     PATRICK2
                           I’m going to die -
                                     DOCTOR PAGAZZI
                           You’re not going to die - 
                                     PATRICK2
                           I don’t mind.

                                breath)
                           I want to die, I want to die, I 
                           want to die...
        41      INT. SUICIDE PREVENTION WARD, REHAB CLINIC 2004 - NIGHT    41
                PATRICK2 writhes on the bed, tangled in the sheets soaked with 
                sweat. Shaking uncontrollably, teeth chattering, he is 
                finding it hard to breathe, suffocating. 
                He leans over the side of the bed. A vivid hallucination, 
                water churning, threatening to drown him.

                walks the corridors.

                Still gaunt and shaking, he sits opposite DOCTOR PAGAZZI.
                                     DOCTOR PAGAZZI
                           How often would you say you have 
                           suicidal thoughts?
                                     PATRICK2
                           When I was younger it’s all I 
                           thought about. I never questioned 
                           it.

                           of a whisper. On a quiet coastal 
                           path, in a chemist, driving on the 
                           motorway -

                           And now? 
                                     PATRICK2
                           I look at the window and wonder 
                           whether this floor is high enough. 
                DOCTOR PAGAZZI takes this in.

                           when I became a man, I put away

                also I am known.                                                      *

                           PATRICK2.
                                     MARY2
                           ...and now abideth faith, hope, 
                           love, these three; but the greatest 
                           of these is love. 
                MARY2 returns. There’s a hiatus as the mourners consult their 
                orders of service. 
                But he’s shaking, resistant. Panic setting in. MARY2 squeezes 
                his hand; Can you do this?
                And PATRICK2 stands a little unsteadily and approaches the 
                lectern -

                PATRICK approaches his mother, who sits at her favourite 
                place. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           Lovely spot.

                           It is. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           Do you...mind if I join you?
                ELEANOR2 looks to PATRICK2; not usual behaviour at all. ELEANOR2 
                stiffens slightly. 
                                     ELEANOR2
                           Please.
                The sun is setting. They sit for a moment, but the tension in 
                the air is palpable and eventually - 
                                     PATRICK2
                           I’ve been trying out different 
                           combinations of words and none of 
                           them are right, so perhaps if I 
                           don’t think too much and just come 
                           out with it.
                               (a deep breath - no 
                                turning back)
                           When we were here, when I was a 
                           child and we used to come here, and 
                           for some years afterwards, DAVID1 
                           used to, he used to rape me -

                           Me too.
                A moment. On PATRICK2, his confusion, his disbelief -  
                                     PATRICK2
                           Me too?
                They return to the view in silence - the subject closed.

                Time passes. The congregation shifts uneasily. He looks to 
                the audience - finds JOHNNY, finds MARY, concerned- the only 
                two who know. He drops his head. On the lectern in front of 
                him, the cue cards, blank except for -  
                ‘?’
                Eventually -

                           A lot has been said about my 
                           ELEANOR1’s innocence, how child-like 
                           she - all I know is that when I was 
                           a child - when DAVID1 - why 
                           didn’t she...couldn’t she -
                               (he’s starting to falter 
                                now, to break down, to 
                                remember -)
                           ‘Me too’! Me too.
                He shakes his head, looks to the audience - finds JOHNNY2, 
                finds MARY2, concerned.
                                     PATRICK2 (CONT’D)
                           I’m sorry, I can’t...I can’t do 
                           this...
                And hurriedly, head down, he walks past the congregation... 
                - and keeps walking, out of the door.
                There’s a brief pause, some awkward shuffling. MUSIC UP, Fly 
                Me to the Moon by Frank Sinatra. Some smiles, some laughter 
                at the choice, relief. The coffin starts to move towards the 
                red curtain.
                MARY2 is on her feet, heading out to -

                CONTINUOUS 
                The crematorium has an outside terrace, and here PATRICK2 
                stands, tearful, ashamed, trying to light a cigarette with 
                shaking hands. He hears the door behind, and glances around.
                                     PATRICK2
                           I swear, if one more person tells 
                           me how innocent ELEANOR1 was -
                                     MARY2
                           She might not have been, but even 
                           so -
                            PATRICK2                     MARY2 (CONT'D)
                Don’t, MARY2, please do not       - it’s an emotional time, 
                try and make things better -     you’re bound to feel -               *
                                     PATRICK2
                           STOP! This isn’t mourning or grief, 
                           it’s rage, I feel my heart racing 
                           with it. She knew, she must have, 
                           surely she must have, even 
                           unconsciously, deep down, she knew 
                           what he was like and yet she failed 
                           to do the single thing she was 
                           obliged to do, to protect her 
                           child!

                           Christ knows I’ve been a fucking

                           he wanted. Nobody should do that to

                           I thought I was getting better, I 
                           really did, but - 
                He holds out his shaking hands, examines them.
                She reaches across. Takes his hand. 
                They sit in silence.

                A procession of limos drives down a street on crematorium 
                grounds. PATRICK2, still shaken, sits in MARY2’s car and looks 
                out the window as the tombstones pass by outside.

                A little way apart from everyone, PATRICK is reading The 
                Tibetan Book of the Dead. Or rather he is pretending to read 
                it. Instead he steals glances at a 20 year-old patient who 
                sits, bored and petulant, across the room. This is BECKY.

                           part, I lay in bed for ten months 
                           not uttering a single syllable and 
                           when I did start I couldn’t stop 
                           because of all the things that had 
                           piled up -

                           human excrement, smeared all over

                           tranquilliser.
                                     BECKY
                           I’m on eight.
                                     PATRICK
                           Then I suppose you win.
                She laughs and puts her hand on his arm and he is in love. 
        52      INT. DEPRESSION SUPPORT GROUP, REHAB CLINIC 2004 - DAY     52
                Another day, PATRICK2 and BECKY seated together now.
                                     JILL
                           I think a lot of my relationship 
                           problem stems from the fact that 
                           the person I’m having a 
                           relationship with doesn’t know 
                           we’re in a relationship.
                                     BECKY
                               (barking with laughter)
                           Fuck, Jill! No wonder you’re here 
                           for the ninth time!
                JILL runs from the room. GORDON, the moderator, turns on 
                BECKY.

                                     GORDON
                           You’re going to have to apologise 
                           for that.
                                     BECKY
                           Why? I meant it!
                                     GORDON
                           That’s why you have to apologise. 
                                     BECKY
                           But I wouldn’t mean it if I 
                           apologised.
                                     TERRY
                           Fake it to make it, man. Fake it to 
                           make it.
                And now BECKY storms out, tossing chairs as she goes. 
                To PATRICK she is perfect!
        53      INT. CORRIDORS, REHAB CLINIC 2004 - DAY                    53
                Later, PATRICK2 is walking along the corridor when he sees 
                BECKY hurrying towards him tearfully. 
                                     BECKY
                           I was looking for you -
                               (pulls him to one side)
                           They’re throwing me out. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           Really?
                                     BECKY
                           They say I’m a disruptive 
                           influence. I ‘don’t contribute’. Of 
                           course I don’t fucking contribute, 
                           I’m depressed! Fuck, I hate this 
                           fucking place!
                GORDON has spotted them. 
                                     GORDON
                           Rebecca - 
                A slip of paper, palmed into PATRICK’s hand.
                                     BECKY
                           I can’t go back to my parents. This 
                           is my sister’s address. She’s away 
                           so I’ll be there alone. 
                She kisses him quickly on the lips.

                                     BECKY
                           Come and find me. 
                And she heads off, glancing back. The slip of paper, held 
                tightly in his hand.

                From the cell-like room to the luxurious black leather of the 
                limo, as it joins the others outside the tall, fine Georgian 
                building on a quiet West London street. They sit in the car, 
                PATRICK still badly shaken.
                                     MARY2
                           Are you going to be alright?
                                     PATRICK2
                           Let’s find out.
                He gets out -
                - and THOMAS runs up and leaps into his arms. He kisses his 
                son, and puts his arm around ROBERT2 who, rather self-
                consciously, embraces his father. 
                                     PATRICK2 (CONT’D)
                           Hello, you two. How’s your other 
                           granny?

                           The same.

                           PATRICK2! After the disinheritance, 
                           it would have been hypocritical of 
                           me to go to the funeral. But the 
                           party’s a different matter. I want 
                           to support you. Of course it helps 
                           that it’s just around the corner.
                PATRICK2 turns and - 
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           PATRICK2, what an unusual speech. So 
                           eloquent. And how thrilling to be 
                           introduced, at my advanced age, to 
                           a new club. ‘The Onslow Club’! I’ve 
                           never heard it mentioned...
                Keen to avoid NICHOLAS2’s corrosive atmosphere, PATRICK2 steps 
                inside -
        62      INT. HALLWAY, RECEPTION, ONSLOW CLUB 2005 - CONTINUOUS     62
                - but NICHOLAS won’t be shaken off.
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           Is this your eldest?
                                     PATRICK2
                           Yes - ROBERT2.
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           What a pity DAVID1 isn’t here to 
                           enjoy your sons. DAVID1 would at least 
                           have ensured that they didn’t spend 
                           the whole day in front of the 
                           television. I remember vividly, 
                           when we had seen some children 
                           practically giving birth to a 
                           cathode ray tube, DAVID1 said to me “I 
                           dread to think what all that 
                           radiation is doing to their little 
                           genitals”
                NICHOLAS2’s hand is on ROBERT2’s head.

                               (to ROBERT2, ending this)
                           ROBERT2, go find your mother -
                               (ROBERT2 leaves)
                           How’s your daughter, NICHOLAS2?

                                     NICHOLAS2
                           Well, I presume. We’ve not spoken 
                           for years. 
                Point scored, PATRICK2 goes to leave, but NICHOLAS2 recovers.
                                     NICHOLAS2 (CONT’D)
                           I can’t help thinking how much your 
                           DAVID1 would have savoured this 
                           occasion. Whatever his drawbacks as 
                           a parent, he never lost his sense 
                           of humour.
                                     PATRICK2
                           Easy not to lose what you never 
                           had.
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           I disagree. DAVID1 saw the funny side 
                           of everything. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           DAVID1 only saw the funny side of 
                           things that didn’t have one.
                NICHOLAS2 begins, with some difficulty, to remove his heavy 
                overcoat.
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           Well, cruelty and laughter have 
                           always been close neighbours...
                                     PATRICK2
                           Close without being incestuous.

                DAVID1     had a rare and       - NICHOLAS2, I understand how 
                precious disdain for the         much you must miss my other 
                opinions of most people. He      amazing parent -                     *

                           to deal with the people who came to 
                           mourn ELEANOR1. 
                And with that, PATRICK2, shaking with rage, hurries upstairs 
                leaving NICHOLAS2 struggling with the straitjacket overcoat. 
                Thankfully -

                           I can’t breathe. It’s like

                           Wine? Champagne? 
                                     PATRICK2

                           thank you. Here.
                But someone else has arrived, a mad-haired, wild-eyed woman, 
                lipstick half an inch to the side of her mouth -  FLEUR.
                                     PATRICK2
                           Oh Christ. It’s Amitriptyline. What 
                           the hell is she doing here?

                                     PATRICK2
                           No, I’ve got to get some air. I’m 
                           going to walk around the block.

                to run -

                Furtive and guilty, a spy under surveillance, his possessions 
                jammed into a plastic bag, PATRICK2 hurries down an exterior 
                walkway towards the exit and freedom. 
                But FLEUR, the manic lady in green, has spotted him - 
                                     PATRICK2
                           Oh Christ - 
                                     FLEUR
                               (a great unloading)
                           Hello, are you leaving? I must say, 
                           I don’t envy you. I love it here, 
                           gets me away from my awful 
                           children, the little shits, I 
                           loathe them. Do you have children 
                           yourself?

                           Actually, I’m sorry, I have to -
                                     FLEUR
                           If I have one word of advice, it’s 
                           this. Amitriptyline. The only time 
                           I’ve been happy was on it, but the 
                           bastards won’t give me any -

                           The thing is, I’m trying not to 
                           take anything.
                                     FLEUR
                           Don’t be ridiculous. It’s the most 
                           marvellous drug.

                about his decision. The drug’s are wearing off, the DTs are 
                returning, and the DRIVER’s banter is failing to cheer him 
                up.

                “...and now I keep thinking I’m a 
                moth!” “Very interesting”, says the 
                psychiatrist, “Und vot made you 
                come here today?” He says “Well, I 
                saw the light in the window...”

                Do you specialise in these jobs

                      DRIVER
                You say that, but last year for 
                four months I literally couldn’t 
                get out of bed. Couldn’t see the 
                point. 
                      PATRICK2

          Familiar west London streets. They arrive, pulling up at the 
          flat, and now PATRICK2 has joined him in the front seat. 
                      DRIVER
                Believe me, Mr PATRICK2 Melrose, in a 
                month’s time you’ll look back at 
                this and think ‘What was all that 
                fuss about?’ ‘What was I thinking!’
          PATRICK2 is scrutinising BECKY’s scrap of paper. If you feel 
          like doing something crazy...
                      DRIVER (CONT’D)
                That’s what happened to me, anyway.
                  (they look to the flat)
                This it then? Very nice. They’ll be 
                pleased to get their dad back.
                      PATRICK2
                Who?
                      DRIVER
                The kids.
                  (offering his hand)
                Good luck with it, mate.
          BECKY at the window, just a glimpse; she doesn’t see PATRICK2.
                      PATRICK2
                Actually, I know this sounds crazy, 
                for want of a better word, but 
                could you take me back?

                                     PATRICK2
                           I don’t think I’m quite ready. 
                Exasperated, the DRIVER starts the car. Under his breath -

                           Fuckin’ hell, you people. 
                And PATRICK takes one last look at BECKY’s flat and the 
                promise of oblivion.
        63F     EXT. ONSLOW GARDENS, WEST LONDON 2005 - DAY               63F
                In the present day, PATRICK slows, stops, stands catching his 
                breath. He looks back in the direction that he has come from, 
                back to the wake - 
        63G     INT. DEPRESSION SUPPORT GROUP, REHAB CLINIC 2004 - DAY    63G
                FLASHBACK. In the support group, TERRY is speaking.
                                     TERRY
                               (Scottish, ex-Meths

                           Fear knocked at the door...
                               (long pause)
                           Courage opened the door...
                               (long pause)
                           And there was nobody there!
                PATRICK2 enters. The group turn to stare.
                                     PATRICK2
                               (taking a seat)
                           Please. Carry on.
                They know what has happened. GORDON gives a little round of 
                applause, joined by JILL, ANNABEL, TERRY, even FLEUR -
                 - until everyone is applauding. Uncharacteristically, 
                PATRICK2 succumbs to the wave of goodwill.

                sees is that large photograph of his mother, welcoming him 
                in. 
                Gradually faces turn to stare -
                Then turn away. MARY smiles. HENRY is chatting amiably to the 
                kids, NICHOLAS ranting at ANNETTE, who smiles benignly.

                           Well done. You came back.

                           Oh, I still want to leave. I want 
                           to leave with that waitress and 
                           never come back.

                           Christ, look at her. D’you think if 
                           I told her it was my mother’s 
                           funeral and I needed cheering up -

                           She might be the one to save you?
                                     PATRICK2
                           It’s worth a try - 
                And he heads towards HELENE but is intercepted by -

                           old friend of ELEANOR1’s.

                           charity shops she ran. I was 
                           thought by some, by everyone in 
                           fact, to be unemployable, but she 
                           trusted me enough to run the 
                           Kensington branch and that, I’m 
                           afraid, is when I had one of my

                           morning, an amazing sable coat, and 
                           I put it on, in July, emptied the 
                           till, shut up shop, hailed a cab 
                           and said ‘Take me to The Ritz!’ I 
                           sat in the Palm Court drinking 
                           champagne cocktails and talking to 
                           anyone who would listen. Eventually 
                           the police were summoned, and I had 
                           no-one to call on but your mother. 
                           She said she was used to it because 
                           she was always clearing her 
                           father’s bar bills in grand places. 
                           I promised I wouldn’t do it again,

                                     JULIA
                           Neither does a salivating dog when 
                           it sits next to you at dinner. 
                           Making little whimpering sounds...
                                     PATRICK
                           Talking to that lunatic did make 
                           her look like the last overhanging 
                           tree before the roar of the 
                           waterfall. 
                                     JULIA
                           Sweet. You’re still trying to be 
                           saved. 
                               (her hand on his arm, the 
                                old rapport)
                           Do you want to come upstairs? For a 
                           cigarette I mean.
                A moment. Then they leave together, noticed by MARY, joined 
                by JOHNNY.
                                     JOHNNY
                           It’s a shame some things don’t 
                           change.
                                     MARY
                           That? Oh, I don’t mind any more. 
                           It’s better now. We’re a lot closer 
                           since we separated.

                                     JULIA2
                           So what did the lunatic say?
                                     PATRICK2
                           She suggested there were no easy 
                           conclusions about what someone’s 
                           life means. 
                                     JULIA2
                           You can come to a conclusion about 
                           what it means to you.
    Patrick Melrose - 'At Last'- Ep 5       44
                      PATRICK2
                Actually, I feel inconclusive about 
                both my parents.
                      JULIA2
                Sounds exhausting. Isn’t it easier 
                just to loathe their guts?
                      PATRICK2
                Yes, I tried that with DAVID1. 
                No good. The truth is I feel 
                everything; contempt, pity, rage, 
                terror... and tenderness -
                      JULIA2
                Tenderness?
                      PATRICK2
                At the thought of how unhappy he 
                was, they both were. Then I 
                remember I have sons of my own and 
                the loathing...floods back.
          But JULIA2, distracted, checks her eyeliner.
                      JULIA2
                I hate bereavement, it plays havoc  
                with your eyeliner. 
                      PATRICK2
                I didn’t realise ELEANOR1 meant so 
                much.
                      JULIA2
                Oh, nothing to do with ELEANOR1. It’s 
                just the way tears spring on you, 
                at a silly film or a funeral. Not 
                brought on by the thing that 
                triggers them, just from a 
                generalised sadness, I suppose. 
                Life being so maddening. 
                      PATRICK2
                Sometimes the trigger and the 
                sadness are the same. Occasionally.
                  (zealous, a resolution)
                Christ, I wonder what it’d be like 
                to have an unconditioned response 
                to things, to anything, without 
                irony or detachment, just to be 
                spontaneous, to feel something - 
                      JULIA2
                Well, it’s no use asking me - 
                      PATRICK2
                No. But I don’t want to die without 
                finding out.
      Patrick Melrose - 'At Last'- Ep 5                                   45
                Suddenly, as if on cue -
                                     HELENE
                           I’m sorry, but you can’t smoke out 
                           here. 
                                     JULIA2
                           Oh. I didn’t know. It’s funny, 
                           because it is outside - 
                                     HELENE
                           Technically it’s still part of the 
                           club, and there’s no smoking 
                           anywhere in the club. 
                                     JULIA2
                           Well, I’d better put it out then. 
                She continues to smoke for a while, a long while, the three 
                of them standing in awkward silence as any feeling that 
                PATRICK might have felt for JULIA drains away. 
                She drops the cigarette on the floor and stalks off. 
                HELENE the WAITRESS sighs and puts down the tray so that she 
                can pick up the smouldering butt. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           Here, let me - 
                And PATRICK bends down, picks it up, drops it on the tray.
                                     PATRICK2 (CONT’D)
                           Sorry about that.
                                     HELENE
                           S’okay. I’m used to it. 
                But before he can think to respond, HELENE leaves.
                A moment. A decision - 
        66      INT. UPSTAIRS, ONSLOW CLUB 2005 - CONTINUOUS               66
                And we follow PATRICK as he rushes through the guests, up to 
                HELENE.
                                     PATRICK2
                           Hello, excuse me, I just wanted -
                                     HELENE
                           Tea or Coffee?
                                     PATRICK2
                               (searching for pen and 
                                paper)
                           Actually, no, something else -  
    Patrick Melrose - 'At Last'- Ep 5       46
          No paper - he’ll have to use the order of service. MARY2, with 
          THOMAS, notices while talking to HENRY.
                      HENRY
                I’d expected more people. She was 
                very well-loved. 
                      MARY2
                ELEANOR1 lost touch with people when she 
                stopped speaking. Must have been 
                terrible, not to be able to say 
                what she wanted, especially to 
                PATRICK1. That’s if she knew what 
                she wanted to say -
                      HENRY
                Poor ELEANOR1. 
                      MARY2
                It’s why we must all resolve to 
                drop our defences and say what we 
                feel, while we can.
                  (THOMAS comes to her, and 
                   jumps into her arms)
                At this point the English usually 
                say ‘Well this is a cheerful 
                subject!’ 
          KETTLE bustles up, HENRY leaves.
                      KETTLE
                I see you two are still glued to 
                each other.
                      MARY2
                  (Enough!)
                Will you go find ROBERT1? 
                  (THOMAS leaves)
                Well, no-one can hope to ignore 
                their children as completely as you 
                did - 
                      KETTLE
                MARY2! We always communicated!
                      MARY2
                Do you remember what you said to me 
                when you telephoned me at school to 
                say daddy had died?
                      KETTLE
                I said how awful it was - 
                      MARY2
                ‘Cheer up!’ Cheer up, you said. You 
                never had any idea who I was then 
                and you still don’t now...
    Patrick Melrose - 'At Last'- Ep 5       47
          And MARY heads off, leaving KETTLE gasping. But here’s FLEUR -
                      FLEUR
                How are you, dear?
                      KETTLE
                Well considering I’ve just had my 
                head bitten off by my daughter -
                      FLEUR
                Has she had mental health problems? 
                      KETTLE
                I beg your pardon?
          HENRY is with NANCY, watching FLEUR in horror.
                      NANCY
                When I think of Mummy’s funeral - 
                eight hundred people, half the 
                French cabinet, the Windsors, the 
                Aga Khan -
                      HENRY
                Eleanor chose a different path. 
                      NANCY
                More like a goat track.
                  (FLEUR is on the move)
                Here comes the Green Goblin. Wagon 
                formation!
          And as NANCY turns her back, FLEUR is left stranded, but 
          rebounds towards NICHOLAS2.
                      FLEUR
                Have you had mental health 
                problems?
                      NICHOLAS2
                Have we met?
                      FLEUR
                I have a feeling for these things. 
                So, have you?
          NICHOLAS2 inhales deeply, then, in a great stream - 
                      NICHOLAS2
                No I have not had ‘mental health 
                problems’. Even in this degenerate 
                age of confession and complaint, 
                when the vocabulary of Freudian 
                mumbo-jumbo is emptied onto every 
                conversation like vinegar onto a 
                newspaper full of sodden chips, 
                some of us choose not to ‘tuck in’!

                Oh yes, never better. I was      - a practising witch-doctor, 
                just trying to help this poor    happy to turn my daughter 
                man who’s had more than his      against her own father for a 
                fair share of mental-health      mere two hundred guineas an          *

                And suddenly NICHOLAS2 rocks sideways on his walking stick, 
                staggers and, grabbing at the tablecloth, pulls the wine 
                bottles and glasses and trays of funeral food down with him.

                Now ANNETTE2 steps in, cradling his head, lips moving in 
                silent prayer. JULIA2, watching -

                           Oh God, that would really finish me 
                           off. Is she praying?

                           That’s nice of her.

                           move on. I’ve always thought 
                           Nicholas Pratt was a perfectly 
                           ghastly man.

                           That’s a horrible thing to say. 
                           He’s just an old man.

                On NICHOLAS2 now. The pride, the eloquence, has all gone and 
                now there’s an awful fear in his eyes, and rage too at his 
                own vulnerability. His mouth works silently, attempting to 
                express the torrent of words in his head. 
                And now, for the first time, PATRICK2 is there, loosening his 
                tie. He grasps at PATRICK2’s hand, staring at him desperately. 
                PATRICK2 does not reject his grip.

                NICHOLAS2 PRATT is carried out on a stretcher to the waiting 
                ambulance. PATRICK2 reports to MARY2, ROBERT2 and THOMAS.

                           I’ll go with him to the hospital.

                and NICHOLAS2, his father’s representative on earth.

                           In the trade it’s what we’d call a

                           Californian - I’m grateful. 
                And then suddenly the family is alone. ROBERT2 takes his 
                PATRICK2’s hand.

                           Are you coming back with us?
                A glance at MARY2 -

                           You’d be very welcome.
                                     PATRICK2
                           No, I’ll see you at the weekend.
                                     MARY2
                           You can come and have dinner with 
                           us if you like. Just us four. Very 
                           quiet.

                           No, I think I’ll just crash out. 
                           It’s been a long day.
                                     MARY2
                           Well, if you change your mind - 
                                     ROBERT2
                           In fact you should change your 
                           mind. That’s what it’s for. 
                PATRICK2 laughs at this. A kiss from MARY2, and they leave. 
                He stands alone for a moment on the street in the spring air.
                FADE TO BLACK. The ringing of a phone, loud, persistent, just 
                as in the opening of Bad News.

                Hello?
                      VOICE
                PATRICK2? Hello, PATRICK2 is that 
                you?
                      PATRICK2
                Yes -
                      ANNETTE2 (O.S.)
                ANNETTE2 here. I’m afraid I have 
                rather bad news. NICHOLAS1 didn’t 
                make it. He stopped breathing in 
                the ambulance. Oh, PATRICK2, are you 
                crying?
                      PATRICK2
                No, just...out of breath. Though of 
                course I’m also very sad.
                      ANNETTE2 (O.S.)
                An amazing man, completely unique.
                      PATRICK2
                Let’s hope so. The idea of a 
                village full of NICHOLAS1 Pratts is 
                rather terrifying.
                  (a change of tone)
                I’m sorry, it just occurred to me 
                that he was the last one. Last of 
                my parents’ circle. They’ve all 
                gone now. 
                      ANNETTE2 (O.S.)
                Oh, now you’re making me cry!
                      PATRICK2
                Really. There’s no need. Thank you 
                for what you said at the funeral 
                too. It was helpful to have another 
                point of view.
                      ANNETTE2 (O.S.)
                She might not have been a perfect 
                ELEANOR1. That must anger you, I 
                expect. But those who deserve the 
                most blame also deserve the most 
                help, and she was fundamentally a 
                good person.
                      PATRICK2
                You seem very sure of that.
                      ANNETTE2 (O.S.)
                I’m sure that she tried, which is 
                as much as any of us can do. 
                Goodbye, PATRICK2. God bless you.

                She hangs up, and after a while PATRICK2 hangs up too. 
                He lies for a moment, looking at the ceiling. The sound of a 
                piano. DAVID2’s theme - 
                                     DAVID2 (O.S.)
                           PATRICK2? PATRICK2, where are you? 
                           PATRICK2!

                The cheap hotel DAVID2 took him too. We’ve seen this 
                before, in Bad News and Some Hope, but now we’re on the other 
                side of the bathroom door with YOUNG PATRICK2, pacing, 
                tearful, fists clenching and unclenching, muttering to 
                himself. 
                YOUNG PATRICK2 looks in the mirror, screwing up all his 
                courage, then walks into the other room -
        71      INT. HOTEL ROOM, PROVENCE 1970 - DAY                       71
                DAVID2 waits.
                                     DAVID2
                           Come and sit here.
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                           No.
                                     DAVID2
                           Beg pardon?
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                           No. I won’t do what you say 
                           anymore! 
                                     DAVID2
                           PATRICK2...
                               (standing, shaken)
                           PATRICK2. Don’t talk like that to 
                           your dear old DAVID2. 
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                               (in a great rush)
                           It’s wrong. DAVID2’re wrong! Nobody 
                           should do that to anybody else and 
                           I won’t have it, I won’t! Not any 
                           more. NO. NO. NO. NO. NO!
                In the face of his PATRICK2 resistance, DAVID2 falters. For the 
                first time, he is vulnerable, weak. 
                DAVID2 feels behind PATRICK2 for the bed and sits, and crumples. In 
                front of PATRICK2’s eyes, DAVID2 MELROSE falls apart.

                There are tears in PATRICK2’s eyes, and for a moment he feels 
                desperately alone in this bedsit, this non-bachelor’s 
                bachelor pad.
                Then he sits suddenly, wipes at his eyes - ‘snap out of it’ - 
                and searches in his pocket.
                Here is the Order of Service, with ELEANOR1’s photo. And here 
                is the waitress’ phone number. Helene 02079460282...
                                     PATRICK2

                He reaches for the phone, looks at the number. He dials.

                           Hello, it’s PATRICK2 here. 
                                     FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                           Oh. Hello. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           I’ve decided I’m bored of ghosts. I 
                           want to see people instead.
                                     FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                           Oh. I see. Okay, well -

                                     PATRICK2 (O.S.)
                           Or is it too late to change my 
                           mind?
                                     MARY2
                           Not at all. After all, that’s what 
                           it’s for.

                PATRICK2 smiles. Hangs up -
                - sits for a moment, then stands with a groan, aching, older 
                than he was. 
        75      INT. HALLWAY, BEDSIT, WEST LONDON 2005 - DAY               75
                PATRICK2 locks the door behind him, walks down the hall.
