                Music up: something nostalgic, perhaps the lush strings that 
                start Louis Armstrong’s I Only Have Eyes for You. 
                A figure sits in the spot that overlooks the vineyard, 
                Eleanor’s favourite spot. A NURSE carries a tray and sets it 
                down on the table. The wheelchair is wheeled around and we 
                see - 
                ELEANOR, transformed. A series of strokes has taken a 
                terrible toll. But she smiles as we -

                ROBERT2, 10 years-old now, walks the rooms of PATRICK1’s silent 
                childhood home, opening doors, re-familiarising himself - and 
                us - with the place. 
                In the drawing room, yoga mats, guitars and drums. Confined 
                to the corner, a shape beneath a dust sheet.
                ROBERT2 pulls back a corner, revealing David’s beloved piano. 
                He plays a high note, taps out a tune.

                spot where Young Patrick waited for Eleanor in ‘Never Mind’.

                MORNING
                The old dining room has become ELEANOR’s bedroom. Robert 
                stands outside a door and watches. From his P.O.V. - 
      Patrick Melrose - 'Mother's Milk' - Ep 4                              2
                ELEANOR1 sits up in bed in the darkened room. A series of 
                terrible strokes have taken their toll, and she looks frail 
                and bewildered and trapped, her face lop-sided, her eyes 
                cloudy.
                A NURSE sits at her side - CLAUDINE, her carer - and puts a 
                cup to her lip. ROBERT2 wonders - should I enter? A whisper - 
                                       MARY2 (O.S.)
                           ROBERT2, darling -

                           Let’s say hello later. We need to 
                           go to the airport. Granny is 
                           waiting.
                ROBERT2 clearly doesn’t relish this.

                MORNING
                PATRICK2 MELROSE, now very much in middle-age, lies contorted, 
                sleeping fitfully. On his bedside table, bottles of pills. 
                Suitcases, yet to be unpacked. 
                A SMALL CHILD tumbles down on his face, causing him to yelp 
                in pain and surprise. 
                                       PATRICK2
                           Fuck-ing hell!
                                       MARY2
                           PATRICK2!
                                       PATRICK2
                           Sorry! Sorry, sorry, sorry Thomas!
                THOMAS, ROBERT1’s younger brother, bounces on the bed.
                                       PATRICK2 (CONT’D)
                           I was just finally dropping off. 
                           I’ve been awake all night. 
                                       MARY2
                           And now it’s time to get up!
                                       PATRICK2
                           I thought we were on holiday.
                                       MARY2
                           Yes, I thought so too, but we’ve 
                           been up since five, haven’t we 
                           Thomas? 
                                 (a kiss goodbye)
                           We’re off to fetch my mother from 
                           the airport.

                                       PATRICK2
                           Well don’t rush back. 
                                       MARY2
                           There’s lots to do. Open all the 
                           windows, air the place.
                                 (heading out)
                           If you could finish unpacking, that 
                           would be very helpful -
                He closes his eyes. A beat, then - 
                The strum of a guitar, the patter of drums. A jam session.  
                PATRICK2 crosses to the window. 
                That wonderful Provençal view, but now on the lawn three 
                figures sit, legs crossed, one of them tapping on the drums.
                PATRICK2 scowls, swears. On the warpath, he crosses to the 
                wardrobe, opens the door - 
                Leaflets, paraphernalia, cardboard boxes full of books. 
        8       EXT. DRIVEWAY, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 2003 - DAY              8
                MARY is just getting into the car when PATRICK2 strides past 
                in t-shirt and pyjama bottoms, his feet rammed into unlaced 
                brogues. In his arms, a bulging box of books and leaflets, 
                all balanced on a cheap notice-board. Forced brightness -
                                       PATRICK2
                           Have a nice trip! Goodbye!
                                       MARY2
                           At least wait until we’ve unpacked - 
                                       PATRICK2
                           I’m just going to say hello! Drive 
                           safely!
                And on he strides to -
        9       EXT. LAWN, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 2003 - CONTINUOUS           9
                SEAMUS2, late forties, beaming and bright, sits with his 
                acolytes, KEVIN and ANNETTE2. 
                                       SEAMUS2
                           Ah, PATRICK2! I thought I heard your 
                           car last night. Welcome back! 
                           ELEANOR1 can’t wait to see you. This 
                           is Kevin, ANNETTE2 -
                                       ANNETTE2/KEVIN
                           Hey, PATRICK2!/Halloooo!

                                       SEAMUS2
                           PATRICK2, we were just discussing  
                           how wonderful ELEANOR1 is, 
                           letting The Foundation use your 
                           beautiful home. Amazing woman. 
                           She’s helped so many people to 
                           connect. 
                                       PATRICK2
                           With what?
                                       SEAMUS2
                           With other realities. 
                                       PATRICK2
                           Yes, well, back in this one -
                                 (the box of books)
                           - when I opened my wardrobe this 
                           morning, there were so many copies 
                           of The Way of the Spirit that they 
                           were getting in the way of the 
                           shoes.  
                                       SEAMUS2
                           The Way of the Shoes. That’s 
                           actually the better title, 
                           reminding us to keep our feet on 
                           the ground. 
                                       PATRICK2
                           Do you think these signs of 
                           institutional life could be removed 
                           when we’re here on holiday? In 
                           August this is our family home.
                                       SEAMUS2
                           Of course. I apologise. 
                                       PATRICK2
                           These leaflets for reiki workshops 
                           and healing circles, they’re wasted 
                           on us. In fact this board, despite 
                           it’s attractive cork surface, is 
                           yours not ours.
                                       SEAMUS2
                           I’ll take it to my cottage -

                           - where she lets me stay -
                                       PATRICK2
                           For how long? I thought you were 
                           going back to Ireland.

                                       SEAMUS2
                           No, I’m staying for the summer. You 
                           won’t know I’m here!
                PATRICK2 manages to stop himself. He turns and leaves, 
                snatching some rogue wind-chimes from the tree as he passes. 
                And SEAMUS watches him go, his good-humour unshakable.
        10      INT. KITCHEN, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 2003 - MORNING          10
                Back inside the house, PATRICK2 takes a moment to calm down. 
                The day is getting hotter already, and he takes a glass of 
                water, fills it, drinks it, goes to put it down - 
                A SCORPION, tiny and delicate, skitters over the draining 
                board. He contemplates killing it, hesitates, takes a glass, 
                places it over the tiny creature. CLAUDINE, ELEANOR1’s nurse, 
                enters.
                                       CLAUDINE
                           Monsieur Melrose?

                           Bonjour Claudine! Comment est ma 
                           ELEANOR1?
                                       CLAUDINE
                           Si vous voulez monter, votre mère 
                           vous attend.
        11      INT. ELEANOR2’S ROOM, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 2003 - MORNING   11
                PATRICK2 enters the dim, stuffy room and crosses to ELEANOR2, 
                who sits in her bed. Even in the light, it’s clear that she 
                has transformed - thinning hair, snaggled teeth, a terrible 
                fearfulness locked into her eyes. Illness has blown her apart 
                like a dandelion clock, but she organises her face into a 
                smile and PATRICK2 does his best to put her at ease.
                                       ELEANOR2
                           I want you to know...that I’m very 
                           unhappy... at not being able 
                           to...communicate.
                                       PATRICK2
                                 (taking a seat)
                           It must be horrible.
                                       ELEANOR2
                           Yes. Horrible. Yes. But I am brave.
                An awkward silence. ELEANOR2 eyes an envelope on her bedside 
                table -

                                       PATRICK2
                           The others are at the airport, 
                           picking up MARY1’s mother. 
                                 (PATRICK2 picks it up, 
                                  opens.)
                           They’re all very keen to see you. 
                           Only when you’re feeling up to it. 
                           Thomas has grown, as you’d expect -
                                 (the contents)
                           What’s this?
                PATRICK2 opens and reads, while ELEANOR2 strains for words.
                                       ELEANOR2
                           Need you. 
                                       PATRICK2
                           I’m sorry, I’m just trying to - 
                                 (a deep breath)
                           This appears... If I understand 
                           correctly, you want to, you intend 
                           to give this house away.
                                       ELEANOR2
                           Yes -
                                       PATRICK2
                           To the Foundation, the 
                           Transpersonal Foundation, with 
                           immediate effect.
                                       ELEANOR2
                           Yes. Soon. Please, understand?
        12      EXT. DRIVEWAY, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 2003 - DAY             12
                The car returns. PATRICK2 comes out to meet them and, dazed 
                and furious, starts to unpack. Here’s KETTLE, MARY2’s mother - 
                sunglasses, flowing dress.
                                       PATRICK2
                           Good flight?
                                       KETTLE
                           Hello, Patrick. No, hideous. There 
                           was an awful woman next me who was 
                           terrifically proud of her breasts 
                           and kept sticking them in her 
                           child’s face.
                                       MARY2
                           It’s called breast-feeding.
      Patrick Melrose - 'Mother's Milk' - Ep 4                              7
                                       KETTLE
                           Thank you, darling. I know it’s all 
                           the rage but when I was having 
                           children, the clever woman was the 
                           one who went to the party looking 
                           as if she’d never been pregnant, 
                           not the one with her breasts 
                           hanging out. At least not for 
                           breast-feeding...oh!
                PATRICK is already walking away with KETTLE’s bag. 
                                       MARY2
                                 (hurrying after)
                           ROBERT2, can you show Granny to her 
                           room. 
                                       KETTLE
                           It’s not too near the children, is 
                           it?
        13      INT. HALLWAY, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 2003 - DAY              13
                KETTLE’s discarded suitcase stands on the landing. 
                                       MARY2 
                           PATRICK2? Where are you?
        14      INT. DRAWING ROOM, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 2003 - DAY         14
                She enters. PATRICK is pouring a glass of wine from a bottle, 
                largely empty. She is shocked, but tries not to betray this.
                                       MARY2
                                 (- the wine)
                           Goodness. What’s happened here? 
                                       PATRICK2
                           A temporary measure.
                                       MARY2
                           It’s been a while.
                                       PATRICK2
                                 (moving on, the letter)
                           ELEANOR1’s excelled herself this time. 
                           From the solicitors, care of my 
                           mother, if ‘care’ is the right 
                           word. I’ve been disinherited.
                                       MARY2
                           What?

                                       PATRICK2
                           ELEANOR1’s signing the house over to 
                           this joke charity. Nothing to us, 
                           nothing to the children. 
                                       MARY2
                           Oh, PATRICK2 -
                                       PATRICK2
                           Oh, and she wants to know if I’ll 
                           check for loopholes. It’s not 
                           enough to be disinherited, I have 
                           to chip in with the paperwork.
                                       MARY2
                           That’s awful. Did ELEANOR1 say why?
                                       PATRICK2
                           It took half the morning, but 
                           apparently she wants to ’do good’. 
                           ELEANOR1 wants to help people, anyone 
                           really, just as long as they’re not 
                           fucking related to her!
                                       MARY2
                           Not so loud!
                                       PATRICK2
                           Oh, and she ‘seeks closure’ and 
                           wants my ‘validation.’ That bastard 
                           SEAMUS1 might as well have been 
                           whispering in her fucking ear! 
                                       MARY2
                           Darling, you’re ranting -
                                       PATRICK2
                           I have to rant! ELEANOR1 was always a 
                           lousy mother, but I hoped she might 
                           take a holiday towards the end of 
                           her life, feel that she’d achieved 
                           enough by way of betrayal and 
                           neglect and that it was time to 
                           have a break, play with her 
                           grandchildren.

                           What frightens me is how much I 
                           loathe her.

                           Reading that letter, I tried to 
                           loosen my collar so I could 
                           breathe, and then I realised it 
                           wasn’t my collar, it was actually a 
                           noose tightening around my neck, a 
                           noose of loathing...

                           I know. What do I loathe then? I 
                           loathe the poison dripping down 
                           from generation to generation. I’d 
                           rather die than inflict the same 
                           thing on our children.

                           let it.

                glass. 
                Giving up on sleep, hung-over, PATRICK2 is making black

                Breakfast. KETTLE, in sun-hat, speaks in a low voice to MARY2, 
                while PATRICK2 drinks coffee and consults papers.
                                       KETTLE
                           She’s giving it all away?

                           Strange kind of charity. 
                A car is pulling up in the driveway. A new arrival. PATRICK2 
                springs to his feet, as ROBERT2 is approaching.
                                       MARY2
                           ROBERT2, go and say hello. 
                                 (under her breath)
                           I’m only telling you in case 
                           PATRICK2 seems a little off. 
                                       KETTLE
                           So he should be. It’s so lovely 
                           here. Nothing at all to the 
                           grandchildren? Goodness, what on 
                           earth did he do to her?

                She’s joined by her daughter, LUCY, shy, the same age as 
                ROBERT2, who loiters shyly.
                                       MARY2
                           Let’s not talk about it, certainly 
                           not in front of the children.
                                       KETTLE
                           Who’s this now?
                                       MARY
                           I told you. It’s PATRICK2’s friend, 
                           JULIA1. Lucy’s her daughter. 
                PATRICK2 kisses and hugs JULIA2, as LUCY loiters.

                           He certainly seems pleased to see 
                           her.

                                 (shouting over)
                           MARY2! Hello there!
                MARY2 forces a smile. 
                                       MARY2
                           He’s just being nice to her. She’s 
                           been having a hard time.
        21      EXT. GARDEN, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 2003 - AFTERNOON         21
                PATRICK and JULIA are lounging in the shade, drinking wine.
                                       PATRICK2
                           Most people wait for their parents 
                           to die with a mixture of sadness 
                           and plans for a new swimming pool. 
                           Seeing as I’m going to have to 
                           renounce the swimming pool, I 
                           thought I might ditch the sadness 
                           too.
                                       JULIA2
                           But can’t you fight it? You’re a 
                           barrister for Christ’s sake. 
                                       PATRICK2
                           She may be an un-maternal idiot, 
                           but it’s still her money. If she 
                           wants to blow the last of it on a 
                           New Age hotel, there’s nothing I 
                           can do to stop her. 
                                       JULIA2
                           Can’t you pretend to be a shaman 
                           and keep the place?
                                       PATRICK2
                           Sadly I’m one of the few people on 
                           the planet with absolutely no 
                           healing powers. 
                Nearby ROBERT2 and LUCY sit reading in silence, some distance 
                apart. 
                                       JULIA2
                           Why aren’t you playing with each 
                           other? Play! Play!
                                       PATRICK2
                           Besides, I have quite enough 
                           trouble looking after my family 
                           without saving the world. 
      Patrick Melrose - 'Mother's Milk' - Ep 4                             12
                                       JULIA2
                           I think looking after your children 
                           can be a way of giving up. 
                                 (PATRICK2 takes this in)
                           They become the whole ones, the 
                           well ones, the ones who don’t drink 
                           too much, get divorced, become 
                           mentally ill. You spend so much 
                           time guarding them from decay and 
                           depression that you end up decayed 
                           and depressed.
                                 (She takes PATRICK2’s 
                                  hand. ROBERT2 sees this)
                           I’m sorry, I’m a little down. Since 
                           the divorce I get these terrible 
                           moments of vertigo, like I don’t 
                           exist. 
                                       ROBERT2
                                 (listening in)
                           I get that!
                                       JULIA2
                           At your age? I think that’s very 
                           pretentious.
                                       ROBERT2
                           It’s true!
                                       PATRICK2
                           But it doesn’t stop you being a 
                           happy child, does it?
                                       ROBERT2
                           Sometimes, when it’s going on.
                Stung by JULIA2’s teasing, ROBERT2 stalks back to his mother.
                                       JULIA2
                                 (laughs, squeezes 
                                  PATRICK2’s hand)
                           You’re doing a wonderful job.
                                       SEAMUS2 (O.C.)
                           Hello, there!
                                       PATRICK2
                           Oh Christ, it’s the landlord.
                PATRICK2 picks up a book, turns his back to SEAMUS2.
                                       JULIA2
                           Am I allowed to talk to him?
                Back to MARY2 and ROBERT2 -
      Patrick Melrose - 'Mother's Milk' - Ep 4                             13
                                       ROBERT2
                           Why does she have to come on our 
                           holiday?
                                       MARY2
                           Well, JULIA1’s on her own now and 
                           daddy wants to cheer her up.
                                       ROBERT2
                           But why?
                                       MARY2
                           I think she makes him feel young. 
                           Look at him. Like a teenager.
                                       ROBERT2
                           I don’t think you like Julia very 
                           much.
                                       MARY2
                           ROBERT2! I do like her. But whereas 
                           clever people are just thinking 
                           aloud, JULIA1 is thinking about what 
                           she sounds like.
                                 (she watches JULIA1 
                                  talking with SEAMUS1)
                           I shouldn’t have said that. Don’t 
                           repeat it. 
                                       ROBERT2
                           Fine. But don’t make me play with 
                           Lucy. 
                                       MARY2
                           We won’t make you, we just thought 
                           it would be nice for you to spend 
                           time with someone your own age. 
                                       ROBERT2
                           You wouldn’t go to tea with someone 
                           just because she was 39. 
                                       MARY
                           Absolutely right. I hope your 
                           father’s not about to start another 
                           fight -
                JULIA2 and SEAMU2S are speaking, JULIA2 dry and sarcastic on 
                PATRICK2’s behalf, while he closes his eyes, bites his tongue.
                                       SEAMUS2
                           I’m writing a book, you see, about 
                           the healing work we do here. 
                                       JULIA2
                           Are you a healer yourself?
      Patrick Melrose - 'Mother's Milk' - Ep 4                             14
                                       PATRICK2
                                 (he can’t help himself)
                           Yes, Seamus, who have you healed?
                                       SEAMUS2
                           Well, I worked in a nursing home 
                           for many years, washing patients 
                           who were covered in their own 
                           faeces, spoon-feeding old people 
                           who couldn’t feed themselves, that 
                           kind of thing. I’m grateful for it. 
                           It kept me grounded. 
                                       PATRICK2
                           Well it’s a shame you didn’t stick 
                           with that, you might have actually 
                           done some tangible good. 
                                       SEAMUS2
                           PATRICK2 likes to keep me grounded 
                           too. But I think we do tangible 
                           good, with the courses we run.
                                       JULIA2
                           But why is it a charity? If people 
                           pay -
                                       SEAMUS2
                           We bring inner-city kids here. They 
                           love it, the meditation, the trance 
                           music, the drumming. They say to me 
                           ‘Seamus, this is incredible, it’s 
                           like tripping without drugs.’
                                       PATRICK2
                           Do we need a charity for tripping? 
                           Of all the ills in the world, it 
                           seems a wild hole to plug. Why not 
                           just give them acid?
                                       SEAMUS2
                           You can tell he’s a barrister!
                                       PATRICK2
                           I’m all for people having hobbies, 
                           but can’t they do it in the comfort 
                           of their homes?
                                       SEAMUS2
                           Sadly, some homes are not that 
                           comfortable.
                                       PATRICK2
                           No. I know the feeling.
                                       SEAMUS2
                           Well. Good to meet you, JULIA2 -

                           Yes, she mentioned that.

                           I’m looking into it. Don’t go

                bedroom has been turned into the Foundations’s office, and 
                PATRICK2 sits with a glass of whisky, and goes through the 
                documents, the bank statements, the tax files -

                ELEANOR2 struggles to eat lunch with CLAUDINE nearby. She has 
                insisted on using the fork, but is finding it difficult.
                                       ELEANOR2
                           Can’t...find my mouth.
                MARY2 steps in, helping her. PATRICK2 finds himself struggling 
                between pity and rage. ROBERT2 observes this. ELEANOR2 shakes 
                her head - no more - and CLAUDINE leaves.

                           PATRICK2 is only trying to help. You 
                           can do what you like, but if you 
                           give away too much, too soon - 
                                       PATRICK2
                           If you could just loan the house 
                           for the time being and decide -
                                       ELEANOR2
                                 (hands over face)
                           I REALLY DO OBJECT!
                MARY2 does what PATRICK2 can’t do and puts her arms around 
                ELEANOR2, calming and soothing her. 
                                       PATRICK2
                           We’ll leave. You must be tired. I’m 
                           sorry if I upset you.
                She holds her hand out to ROBERT2. Confused, he goes over, 
                leans in to kiss her. She holds him, whispers in his ear.
                                       ELEANOR2
                           Don’t...leave me.
                                       ROBERT2
                           Now?
                Her hand is tight on his arm. 
                                       ELEANOR2
                           Don’t...no...
                But ROBERT2 steps back, turns away and leaves with his father.

                ROBERT2 watches PATRICK2 as he opens a bottle of wine, 
                frightened and confused. MARY2 enters
                                       PATRICK2
                           What can drive a man mad is being 
                           forced to have the emotion he’s 
                           being forbidden to have at the same 
                           time. The treachery makes me feel 
                           furious, and now I’m forced to feel 
                           pity. Well I’m a simple sort of man 
                           and I remain fucking angry! 
                                       MARY2
                           ROBERT2, everyone’s by the pool, go 
                           and join them. 
                                 (once he has gone)
                           I don’t think it’s kind to turn 
                           ROBERT2 against his ELEANOR1.

                           In a beauty contest between her 
                           only child and a complete stranger, 
                           my mother chose the stranger -
                                       MARY2
                           - and you’re right to feel 
                           betrayed, but ROBERT1 -
                                       PATRICK2
                           No, she lied to all of us. At every 
                           stage she told me, this is destined 
                           for Robert, this is for Thomas, for 
                           our children, but all those little 
                           concessions to family feeling are 
                           being tossed away, replaced by the 
                           trademark family malice and spite. 
                                       MARY2
                           That’s not inevitable -
                                       PATRICK2
                           Isn’t it? 
                                       MARY2
                           Not necessarily. Please - spend 
                           time with the children. That’s why 
                           we’re here.
        28      EXT. SWIMMING POOL, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 2003 - AFTERNOON 28
                And now PATRICK2, bottle in hand, has thrown all that energy 
                into being an aggressively good dad. MARY follows him down to 
                the pool, where JULIA2, KETTLE, ROBERT2 and  LUCY are reading 
                quite contentedly.
      Patrick Melrose - 'Mother's Milk' - Ep 4                             18
                                       PATRICK2
                           Right. Who wants to play in the 
                           pool? ROBERT2?
                                       ROBERT2
                           I’m reading! 
                                       PATRICK2
                           Nonsense. Let’s play, that’s why 
                           we’re here. Lucy? JULIA2? No?
                JULIA2 shakes her head and returns to her book.
        29      EXT. SWIMMING POOL, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 2003 - AFTERNOON 29
                And now they’re in the pool for a  kind of water-rugby, with 
                PATRICK2 a little too enthusiastic.
                So that when ROBERT2 has the ball, PATRICK2 grabs it too, and 
                tries to keep hold of it. There’s a tussle, light-hearted 
                enough, but when ROBERT2 wins and snatches the ball, there’s a 
                suspended moment - 
                - before PATRICK2 lunges at him a little too hard and ROBERT2 
                goes underwater. The play-fighting continues a moment too 
                long, with ROBERT2 underwater. He burst to the top, panicked, 
                reaching for the side.
                                       MARY2
                           ROBERT2!
                                       PATRICK2
                           He’s alright, we’re just playing -
                                       MARY2
                           It’s too much - 
                                       KETTLE
                           I knew this would happen, I could 
                           feel it - 
                                       PATRICK2
                           For Christ’s sake, Kettle -
                                       JULIA2
                           I’m sure he’s fine -
                MARY pulls him out of the pool. 
                                       PATRICK2
                           There’s nothing to see. You’re 
                           okay, aren’t you? ROBERT??
                MARY2 is there. He’s tearful, shaken, but loyal to his father -
                                       ROBERT2
                           I’m fine. Really. It’s just a game.

                But PATRICK2 stands alone in the centre of the pool.
                                       PATRICK2
                           There, you see?
                Only JULIA2 gives him a sympathetic look.  
        30      INT. KITCHEN, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 2003 - EVENING          30
                A little later - dressed for the evening. PATRICK2 has snuck 
                inside. Somewhat furtively, he is shaking pills into the palm 
                of his hand. Behind him, JULIA2 is bringing in plates from 
                supper. 
                                       JULIA2
                           That looks like fun.
                                       PATRICK2
                           Not fun, a necessity I’m afraid -
                                 (he shows her the label)
                           Want one?
                                       JULIA2
                           I’ve got my own -
                                       PATRICK2
                           Of course you have -
                                       JULIA2
                           - but if you’re offering. How long?
                                       PATRICK2
                           Four years. 
                                       JULIA2
                           I thought you were only meant to 
                           take it for thirty days. 
                He shakes a pill into her hand. 
                                       PATRICK2
                           Oh, I definitely have a problem, 
                           namely it’s not strong enough. I 
                           get all the side effects, memory 
                           loss, dehydration, nightmarish 
                           withdrawals, everything except  
                           sleep.
                                 (pills between finger 
                                  and thumb)
                           Strange to think that we used to do 
                           this for fun. Remember taking acid 
                           in Greece?
                                       JULIA2
                           I remember where you stashed it.
      Patrick Melrose - 'Mother's Milk' - Ep 4                             20
                                       PATRICK2
                           Yes, sorry about that.
                                       JULIA2
                           Obviously I didn’t mind. But. Let’s 
                           not get nostalgic. 
                                       PATRICK2
                           Another pleasure denied. 
                He pours wine, to wash them down.
                                       JULIA2
                           Whenever I get nostalgic I force 
                           myself to remember what youth was 
                           actually like. 
                                       PATRICK2
                           It was awful. The trouble is, all I 
                           really remember is sex. A great 
                           abundance of sex and a sense of 
                           potential, instead of the absence 
                           of sex and a sense of waste. 
                           Christ, I’m going to need 40mg 
                           tonight.
                                       JULIA2
                           Perhaps - perhaps we shouldn’t have 
                           this conversation.
                                       PATRICK2
                           Perhaps not.
                He lifts the glass, and they swallow their pills together.

                But even 40mg is not enough. In his old childhood bedroom, 
                PATRICK2’s feet stick out the bottom of the tiny bed. No hope 
                of sleep, memories crowding in. A whisper - 
                                       ELEANOR2 (V.O.)
                           Hello, my darling PATRICK2. I’m so sorry 
                           to wake you -

                DAWN
                - as we flashback to ELEANOR2, in this same room, speaking 
                soft and low -

                           What time is it?
                                       ELEANOR2
                           It’s very early. 
                                       YOUNG PATRICK2
                           Are we going now?
                                 (ELEANOR2 nods)
                           Shall I pack my bag?
                                       ELEANOR2
                           Oh, my darling -
                                 (taking his hand)
                           I’ve got to go without you.
                                       YOUNG PATRICK2
                           You can’t -

                           PATRICK2! Listen to me, this is 
                           important. If we’re to be together 
                           I must do this exactly right. I 
                           have to speak to the lawyers first. 
                           It won’t be long, but I must be 
                           careful, do this properly, then I 
                           can come back for you. Do you 
                           understand? PATRICK2 - do you 
                           understand?
        33      INT. THOMAS’S BEDROOM, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 2003 - NIGHT   33
                Back in the present day, PATRICK2 abandons any hope of sleep 
                in this room. He sits -
        34      INT. CORRIDOR, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 2003 - NIGHT           34
                - and walks along the corridor, heal to toe, until he reaches 
                JULIA2’s door. He pauses, reaches for the handle - 
                                       ROBERT2
                           PATRICK2.
                ROBERT2 rubs his eyes, pale and frowning.
                                       PATRICK2
                           Hello.
      Patrick Melrose - 'Mother's Milk' - Ep 4                             22
                                       ROBERT2
                           What are you doing?
                                       PATRICK2
                           Good question. Thomas has pushed me 
                           out of bed again, so I thought I’d 
                           go and sleep in his room.
                                       ROBERT2
                           But that’s JULIA1’s room. 
                                       PATRICK2
                           Yes, I wanted to check she was - 
                                 (on cue - THOMAS crying)
                           Poor Thomas, I’d better, you must - 
                           Goodnight.
                And wincing, cursing himself, he walks away.

                And now PATRICK2 stands in pyjamas and sunglasses, DAVID1 
                Melrose-style, watching the automated pool-cleaner crawl 
                round the floor of the pool. Ennui - failing as a father, 
                failing as a husband, failing as a son.
        36      EXT. BEDROOM, GATE TERRACE, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 2003 - DAY36
                Seated in her wheelchair, PATRICK2 pushes ELEANOR2 into the 
                glaring light. She shields her eyes. 
        37      EXT. TERRACE, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 2003 - DAY              37
                A long table has been laid out - JULIA2, LUCY, ROBERT2, MARY2 
                are there, CLAUDINE helping with THOMAS. PATRICK2 pushes 
                ELEANOR2 to KETTLE, aloof in dark glasses and sun hat, 
                conspicuously uninterested.
                                       PATRICK2
                           I must say, it’s like a dream, 
                           having both of you here together at 
                           the same time.
                                       ELEANOR2
                           Like a...dream. 
                                       KETTLE
                                 (indifferent)
                           My dear, so nice to see you out. 
                           How are you?
                                       ELEANOR2

                                 (crossing to MARY)
                           Well, I’ll leave you two to chat.
                The struggle continues, KETTLE’s interest visibly waning.
                                       MARY2
                           Thomas, don’t touch the wine, 
                           that’s for grown-ups.
                                       PATRICK2
                           It certainly is.
                                       MARY2
                                 (the wine -)
                           Is that the answer?
                                       PATRICK2
                           We’ll find out.
                                       MARY2
                           I’m sure we will.
                CLAUDINE leads THOMAS away to play elsewhere. 
                                       KETTLE
                           I was going to buy Thomas some 
                           child reins for his birthday but 
                           apparently they’re out of fashion.  
                                       MARY2
                           I am not putting my child in a 
                           harness!
                                       KETTLE
                           Really? Nanny used to swear by 
                           them.
                                       MARY2
                           And I used to swear at them. 
                                       KETTLE
                           You didn’t actually, because 
                           swearing was not allowed, unlike in 
                           some households.
                                       PATRICK2
                                 (to MARY2 -)
                           Which one of our mothers is worst, 
                           d’you think? I realise the 
                           disinheritance-thing gives ELEANOR2 
                           the edge, but yours is certainly 
                           putting in the work -

                                 (more wine for PATRICK2)

                           Anyone who thinks a week is a long 
                           time in politics should have her to 
                           stay. A week is a fucking eternity - 
                                       JULIA2
                           I don’t know how you cope without a 
                           nanny.
                                       MARY2
                           I don’t know how I’d cope with one. 
                           I’ve always wanted to look after 
                           the children myself.
                                       JULIA2
                           Yes, motherhood takes some people 
                           that way. It didn’t in my case, but 
                           I was quite young when I had Lucy. 
                                 (MARY2 bites her tongue.)
                           I think you can be too nice to 
                           children. If you want them to be 
                           television producers or chief 
                           executives it’s no use filling 
                           their heads with ideas of trust and 
                           truth-telling and reliability. They 
                           won’t be able to compete in the 
                           real world.

                           Hello there! 
                SEAMUS2 is approaching the house. PATRICK2 bridles, but keeps 
                quiet. 
                                       SEAMUS2 (CONT’D)
                           I was going to call by and see 
                           ELEANOR2, but here she is now.
                But KETTLE would love an escape from ELEANOR2’s company. 
                Making room -

                           Seamus, please sit here, join us 
                           for lunch.
                                       SEAMUS2
                           Oh, I wouldn’t want to intrude on a 
                           family affair. 
                                 (reaching for food)
                           Perhaps for a moment or two. 
                PATRICK2 exchanges an ironic look with JULIA2, pours wine.
                                       KETTLE
                           Patrick says you’re a writer.

                           Did I?. 
                                       KETTLE
                           I’ve sometimes wondered myself 
                           about writing a book. I have so 
                           many ideas, it’s just getting them 
                           down on paper.
                SEAMUS2 is ignoring ELEANOR2 and chatting up KETTLE with the 
                full force of his charm. ELEANOR2, jilted, looks on, 
                neglected.
                                       SEAMUS2

                           I’ve done the beginning, several 
                           beginnings. But then maybe it’s all 
                           beginnings, do you know what I 
                           mean?

                           I must say, it all sounds 
                           absolutely fascinating.

                           PATRICK2, I’m going to do a 
                           workshop!
                                       PATRICK2
                           You should. It’s the only way 
                           you’ll see the house in the cherry 
                           season.

                           Ah, the cherries. Now they’re 
                           something. We always have a ritual 
                           around the cherries, don’t we 
                           ELEANOR2? You know, the fruits of 
                           life.

                           Sounds very profound. Do they taste 
                           better than if they were simply the 
                           fruits of the cherry tree?

                Embarrassment. Shame. SEAMUS2 smiles, squeezes her hand and 
                speaks quietly to her. 
                ROBERT2, meanwhile, stands abruptly and walks away. MARY2 goes 
                to follow.

                           No, I’ll go. It’s my fault.

                ROBERT2 sits with his legs in the pool as PATRICK2 approaches 
                and joins him.
                                       PATRICK2
                           I’m not giving you much of a 
                           holiday, am I? I’m sorry. Must try 
                           harder.
                                       ROBERT2
                           Is ELEANOR1 really giving this away?
                                       PATRICK2
                           That’s what ELEANOR1 wants to do.
                                       ROBERT2
                           But...we love it here.

                           Yes, but this is ELEANOR1, not ours. 
                           ELEANOR1’s always been pathologically 
                           generous, and if she was giving it 
                           to the blind, or the homeless, or 
                           to medical research or the victims 
                           of torture, we’d understand.
                                       ROBERT2
                           But ELEANOR1’s giving it to SEAMUS1.

                           To the Foundation, so yes - to 
                           SEAMUS1.
                                       ROBERT2
                           Do you loathe ELEANOR1?
                                       PATRICK2
                           Of course not, and you mustn’t 
                           either. 
                JULIA2 arrives -
                                       JULIA2
                           Well, this is a touching scene. 
                           MARY1 wants you back, before SEAMUS1 
                           seduces Kettle. 
                                       PATRICK2
                           He’s trying to get MARY1 
                           disinherited too. We’ll have to 
                           kill him after all.
                                       ROBERT2
                           If we kill SEAMUS1, will we keep the 
                           house? 
                                       PATRICK2
                           Sadly not.
                                       JULIA2
                           More efficient to kill Kettle, 
                           before she changes her will.
                                       PATRICK2
                           You’re right. I let emotion cloud 
                           my judgement.
                But it’s all too much for ROBERT2 - too much malice, too 
                flirtatious. He leaves and, with some remorse, PATRICK2
                watches him go.
                                       PATRICK2 (CONT’D)
                           Tell them we’re on our way!
                                 (Watching ROBERT2 go -)
                           I should be more careful I suppose.

                           About what?
                                       PATRICK2
                           I’ve tried so hard not to pass on 
                           the malice and resentment, to give 
                           them a different sort of childhood, 
                           but they’re just fresh mistakes. 
                           And ROBERT2 notices everything -
                                 (she sits next to him)
                           He caught me outside your room last 
                           night.
                                       JULIA2
                           What were you doing outside my 
                           room?
                                       PATRICK2
                           I thought I’d come and see you. 
                           Would you have been pleased?
                A moment, then she leans across and kisses him.
                                       JULIA2
                           Maybe next time. 
                                       PATRICK2
                           Is there going to be a next time?
                                       JULIA2
                           You’re bored and lonely, I’m bored 
                           and lonely -
                                       PATRICK2
                           That’s a terrifying amount of 
                           boredom and loneliness in one room.
                                       JULIA2
                           Maybe they’ll cancel each other 
                           out. Like electrical charges. 
                                       PATRICK2
                           We should conduct an experiment. 
                                       JULIA2
                           In controlled conditions.
                                       PATRICK2
                           See whether we eliminate boredom or 
                           achieve an overload of loneliness. 
                They kiss again.
                                       JULIA2
                           We should go back, or people will 
                           think we’re having an affair.

                A chair, David’s favourite. PATRICK2 stands on it, a little 
                woozy. Clamped between his teeth, like a pirate, is a 
                screwdriver, and he now attempts to unscrew an oil painting 
                from the wall. 
                MARY2 watches from the doorway.
                                       MARY2
                           I’m almost too scared to ask. 
                                       PATRICK2
                           I’m cheering myself up. These are 
                           by Boudin. Sell these and we might 
                           just be able to afford a second 
                           bedroom in Queens Park, a normal, 
                           child-sized bedroom rather than a 
                           converted broom cupboard - 
                                       MARY2
                           You can’t steal from her.
                                       PATRICK2
                           Not from her, from him. If he’s 
                           getting the house, I’m at least 
                           going to keep the fucking Boudins. 
                           Pass me that other screwdriver, 
                           will you? 
                                       MARY2
                           You can’t keep this up. At some 
                           point, you’ll have to let it all 
                           go.

                           Bit late for that -
                                       MARY2
                           I don’t mean the house.
                                 (PATRICK2 doesn’t speak)

                           screwdriver, will you? 
                                 (but MARY2 has already 
                                  left him)

                light in JULIA1’s window.
        42      INT. CORRIDOR/JULIA1’S BEDROOM, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 2003 - 42
                NIGHT
                PATRICK pushes at the door, which is open. JULIA2 lies awake. 
                                       PATRICK2
                           Can I come in?
                He enters, and JULIA2 sits, and they kiss. After a moment -
                                       JULIA2
                           Are you alright? You seem 
                           elsewhere.
                                       PATRICK2
                           No. No, I’m here.
                And they begin to undress.
        43      INT. JULIA2’S BEDROOM, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 2003 - DAWN     43
                They lie in bed as the sun rises. That air of detachment 
                still lingers; they’re tender, but self-conscious too.
                                       PATRICK2
                           What time’s your flight?
                                       JULIA2
                           We have to leave here at nine. 
                                       PATRICK2
                           Our timing - 
                                       JULIA2
                           - has never been very good.
                They kiss.
                                       PATRICK2
                           I should go. Before Thomas wakes 
                           up. 
                                       JULIA2
                           PATRICK2. Summer fling. Yes?
                A genuine question. Neither of them quite know what this is 
                yet.
                                       PATRICK2
                           Summer fling.

        44      EXT. DRIVEWAY, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 2003 - DAY             44
                Departures. JULIA2 and LUCY are giving KETTLE a lift to the 
                airport. PATRICK2 is helping her with the bags.
                                       JULIA2
                           Well, thank you for having us. 
                                       PATRICK2
                           We’ll speak on the phone.
                                       JULIA2
                           When you get a chance.
                                       PATRICK2
                           It won’t be the same. 
                                       JULIA2
                           No. It won’t. ‘Bye. 
                 - and we see this conversation from MARY2’s P.O.V. - a 
                pointedly chaste peck on the cheek between PATRICK2 and JULIA2, 
                but MARY2 isn’t fooled. KETTLE arrives.
                                       KETTLE
                           Oh, dear. I wanted to say goodbye 
                           to SEAMUS1. Send him my love, won’t 
                           you?  It’ll be strange to be here 
                           without  you, PATRICK2. Oh - is this 
                           your  car? It’s very small... 
                MARY2 waves them all off. PATRICK2 walks away, pointedly not  
                looking back.   
                                       PATRICK2
                           Just us, thank God. Now we can have 
                           fun.
        45      EXT. SWIMMING POOL, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 2003 - DAY        45
                Smouldering cigar, black sunglasses and wine glass, PATRICK 
                sits, detached, while the children play nearby. Documents, 
                papers from the solicitors.
                MARY edits a manuscript. A tense and fragile peace.
                                       ROBERT
                           Ow! Something bit me!
                                       MARY
                           Let me see.
                                       ROBERT
                           Mosquito, right near my eye. 
      Patrick Melrose - 'Mother's Milk' - Ep 4                             32
                                       PATRICK
                           Don’t be too hard on mosquitos. 
                           Only the pregnant female whines, 
                           whereas women never stop...
                The awful remark hangs in the air. Behind his dark glasses, 
                PATRICK feels the hot flush of shame. 
                                       PATRICK (CONT’D)
                           I’m sorry, I don’t know why I said 
                           that. Here, let me help.
                And he stumbles up to play with THOMAS, but the atmosphere 
                has soured. Too drunk, too early in the day.
                                       PATRICK (CONT’D)
                           Actually, I’m going to make some 
                           coffee.
                He leaves. MARY watches, compassion fading. Growing hard.
        46      INT. KITCHEN, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 2003 - DAY              46
                In the kitchen, PATRICK spoons out coffee. His hand is 
                shaking - a new development.
                Spilt sugar - echoes of ‘Some Hope’, the nightmare of relapse 
                and recovery. 
        47      INT. OFFICE, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 2003 - DAY               47
                In the office, the fax chugs away. Legal documents to sign. 
                He eyes the phone, picks it up, dials. The murmur of an 
                answering machine.
                                       PATRICK
                           Hello. Just checking that you got 
                           back safely -
                And we switch P.O.V.’s to MARY in the hallway, watching, 
                guessing. 
                PATRICK sees her too, hangs up with his finger, changes tone.  
                                       PATRICK (CONT’D)
                           I’ll try again tomorrow. Bye.
                                 (turning to the papers)
                           Solicitors. Nearly there. 
        48      INT. BEDROOM, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 2003 - NIGHT            48
                And now MARY and PATRICK both lie rigid, tense, as the 
                electric fan clicks - click - click. 
                PATRICK gives in, gets up. MARY - wide awake.

        49      INT. DRAWING ROOM, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 2003 - NIGHT       49
                PATRICK is back on the chair, screwing the stolen Boudins 
                back into place. In dressing gown, MARY watches from the 
                doorway. 
                                       PATRICK2
                           It’s the right thing to do.
                                       MARY2
                           I’m sure it is. 
                                       PATRICK2
                           Also, they’re fakes. I spoke to a 
                           man at Sothebys. You can tell from 
                           the waves apparently. SEAMUS1 isn’t 
                           the first person to bamboozle ELEANOR1, 
                           some art dealer in Paris pulled off 
                           that facile trick thirty years ago.
                                       MARY2
                           Well, let’s not tell SEAMUS1.
                                       PATRICK2
                           Certainly not. 
                                       MARY2
                           Imagine his face when he finds out. 
                                       PATRICK2
                           ‘Dere go da flotation tanks!’
                And they laugh together - a great relief.
        50      INT. DRAWING ROOM, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 2003 - NIGHT       50
                 - and now they lie together on the sofa. Quiet, tender -
                                       PATRICK
                           I think - 
                                       MARY
                           Go on -
                                       PATRICK
                           I need to let this all go. The 
                           family’s being split in half and 
                           the only way to keep together is to 
                           drop the whole thing. 
                                       MARY
                           We couldn’t afford the upkeep 
                           anyway. Let Seamus worry about it.
                                       PATRICK
                           It’s not about the money -
      Patrick Melrose - 'Mother's Milk' - Ep 4                             34
                                       MARY2
                           I know -
                                 (a deep breath)
                           But when you’ve talked about the 
                           things that happened here - won’t 
                           it help? To move on?
                                       PATRICK2
                           Perhaps. If I didn’t have my 
                           ELEANOR1’s protection, at least I had 
                           the protection of this place. Now 
                           that’s being taken away too, I feel 
                           I might go mad. At the same time, 
                           part of me can’t wait to get rid of 
                           the fucking place.  
                                       MARY2
                           Then let’s go back to London.
                                       PATRICK2
                           Or somewhere else. After this 
                           holiday, we need a holiday.
                                       MARY2
                           Where would we go?
        51      INT. HALLWAY, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 2003 - DAY              51
                Sweating, mopping his brow, a SMARTLY-DRESSED MAN waits in 
                the doorway, briefcase in hand. 
                PATRICK greets him, shakes his hand, leads him upstairs. 
        52      INT. ELEANOR2’S BEDROOM, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 2003 - DAY    52
                - and now he produces from his briefcase an official stamp, 
                pens, documents. M. GAUTIER is the notary, here to witness 
                the signing.
                ELEANOR2 sits with a pen, the documents in front of her. MARY2 
                and CLAUDINE the nurse are also present. PATRICK2 places the 
                documents in front of her - indicates where she must sign. 
                Hands her the pen. 
                She signs. Signs again. 
                M.GAUTIER stamps the document. 
                                       PATRICK2
                           There we are. C’est fini. 
                ELEANOR2 beckons PATRICK2 closer, presses a note into PATRICK2 hand. 
                Crumpled paper. He reads the scrawl. ‘why SEAMUS1 no come’ 
                                       PATRICK2 (CONT’D)
                           I’m sure there’s a good reason.

        53      INT. ELEANOR2’S BEDROOM, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 2003 - DAY    53
                Later. PATRICK2 sits and reads at ELEANOR2’s side. But there’s 
                noise from the corridor. ELEANOR2 stirs, panicked. 
                                       PATRICK2
                           I’ll go and see.
        54      INT. KITCHEN, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 2003 - DAY              54
                PATRICK’s P.O.V. as he walks towards the kitchen where the 
                hippyish couple are happily making tea for themselves. KEVIN 
                and ANNETTE2, with rucksacks on their backs.
                                       KEVIN
                           Hello there! We’re back! It’s 
                           Patrick, isn’t it? Kevin, ANNETTE2 -
                                       ANNETTE2
                           We’re making tea. D’you have any 
                           fresh lemons?
                                       PATRICK2
                           I don’t understand -
                                       ANNETTE2
                           Oh. Did SEAMUS1 not talk to you? He 
                           said you might have a spare room?
        55      EXT. THE GUEST HOUSE, LACOSTE 2003 - DAY                   55
                PATRICK, furious, storms towards the Guest House, where 
                SEAMUS sits, reading in the sun. 
                                       PATRICK2
                           SEAMUS2, I don’t want to disturb 
                           your hard work - 
                                       SEAMUS2
                           Not at all. Please, here
                                 (offering up a chair)
                            - be my guest. 
                                       PATRICK2
                           Is that what I am now? Your guest? 
                           Or are you in fact our guest until 
                           we leave? 
                       PATRICK2 (CONT’D)                     SEAMUS2                            *
                Because we are not prepared      I merely thought, given that                 **

                           The terms of my ELEANOR1 gift are 
                           absolutely clear - 
                MARY2 follows on, ROBERT2 behind her.
                            SEAMUS2                           MARY2                             *
                ‘Terms’ is a very legalistic     Go back to the house, ROBERT2.                *
                way of putting it. There’s 
                nothing in writing about the 
                Foundation providing you with 
                a free holiday. I have a 
                genuine sympathy for the                                                      *
                trouble you’ve had in 
                accepting your mother’s 
                wishes - 
                                       PATRICK2 (CONT’D)
                           We’re not talking about the trouble 
                           I’ve had, we’re talking about the 
                           trouble you’re having - 
                                       SEAMUS2
                           They’re inseparable!
                                       PATRICK2
                           Everything looks inseparable to a 
                           moron!
                                       MARY2
                           Let’s all calm down, shall we?
                                       PATRICK2
                           MARY2’s your great defender, 
                           SEAMUS2. My theory is you’re a bad 
                           man pretending to be an idiot 
                           whereas she thinks you’re merely an 
                           idiot.
                                       MARY2
                           If we could stay on the subject - 
                ROBERT2 has returned and listens in, shocked by it all.
                                       SEAMUS2
                           Perhaps the community should hold a 
                           meeting, Kevin and ANNETTE1, MARY2 
                           and yourself - 
                                       PATRICK2
                           We’re not part of your fucking 
                           ‘community’!
                                       SEAMUS2
                           If you don’t want to be part of it, 
                           then perhaps you should go.

                                       MARY2
                           Well. At least we know where we 
                           stand. 
                And now ROBERT can bear it no longer.
                                       ROBERT2
                           Why don’t you go away, you horrible 
                           man, and leave us alone! This is my 
                           ELEANOR1’s house and we have 
                           more right to be here than you do!
                MARY2 takes his hand and tries to calm him down. PATRICK2 joins 
                them, a united front. Faced with this, SEAMUS2 retreats. 
                                       SEAMUS2
                           Well I’m going to have to process 
                           some of these negative feelings. 
                                       PATRICK2
                           Fine. You process away. Be my 
                           guest. Do a ritual!
                And he starts to walk away. The family head back towards the 
                house, but PATRICK2 can’t resist one more attack. He turns, 
                looking truly murderous. MARY2 watches -

                           One last thing. ELEANOR1 gave me 
                           this -
                                 (the slip of paper)
                           It’s a little shaky, she’s not 
                           well. It says ‘why SEAMUS2 no come’. 
                           Now she’s given you the house 
                           you’ve dropped her.
                                       SEAMUS2
                           I don’t need lectures from you on 
                           the importance of my friendship 
                           with ELEANOR1.
                                       PATRICK2
                           Just go and see her. I know she’s 
                           not great company but that’s just 
                           one of the treasure trove of things 
                           you have in common.
                                       SEAMUS2
                           I don’t have to stand for these 
                           insults. You have no idea what an 
                           extraordinary woman she is.
                                       PATRICK2
                           You’re quite wrong. I couldn’t wish 
                           for a more extraordinary ELEANOR1. 
                He walks back to his family, and they walk away united, for 
                the moment at least.

                           Do you remember the olden days, 
                           when we used to go to bed in the 
                           afternoon.

                           That’s not the reason. We’re not

                           For Christ’s sake, I have one hour. 
                           One hour to finish packing, find a 
                           nursing home, finish all my work, 
                           make phone calls, talk to Robert, 
                           and now I have to make you feel 
                           better too!
                                       PATRICK
                           Fine, forget I asked.
                                       MARY
                           - and why do you always ask for 
                           attention when you know it’s 
                           impossible? I think you’d be 
                           horrified if I tried to make love 
                           to you now. 
                                       PATRICK
                           Well, not horrified.

                           see.
                They lie there, and close their eyes.

                spot where he waited uselessly for ELEANOR2 in Never Mind.
                He walks down the corridor, stops a moment. Through the gap 
                in the door to ELEANOR2’s room -

                           Can I get you anything, or -?

                PATRICK2 is speechless for a moment, then.

                           I’d love to help, but it’s against

                Looking for solace in practicality, he begins to feed her, 
                supporting her head as she takes sips from the plastic cup. 
                There’s a new, unexpected tenderness to all of this - he 
                takes great care. 
                But now CLAUDINE is back. He kisses his mother’s forehead.

                Shaken by ELEANOR2’s request, PATRICK2 approaches MARY2 and 
                ROBERT2, who wait silhouetted in the doorway.

                One last look, and they step out into the sunlight. PATRICK2

                ELEANOR hears the slamming of the door, the sound of the

                It’s 1982, and PATRICK2’s younger self is making that twitchy, 
                paranoid trip to pick up DAVID2’s ashes.
                The MANHATTAN skyline. The Empire State, the Chrysler, the 
                WORLD TRADE CENTER - 
                The sweat on his forehead, the leg that won’t stop shaking. 
                C.U. of his hand, nervously tapping, fingers tensing. Another 
                hand takes his, a child’s hand, and -

                We’re in the present day. ROBERT2’s face pressed to the taxi 
                window. PATRICK2 smiles at his excitement.
                                       PATRICK2
                           What d’you think?
                                       ROBERT2 (O.C.)
                           It’s exactly like I expected it to 
                           be.

                They join MARY and THOMAS on the pavement outside a generic 
                midtown mid-price hotel. No porters or bellboys here. They 
                struggle in with their bags.

                Curtains are pulled apart to reveal - a brick wall, a fire 
                escape. Two adjoining rooms, a fold-out sofa and TV. THOMAS, 
                now wide awake, jumps on one bed while ROBERT, exhausted, 
                flicks through the cable channels.

                           So much for the views. It’s like 
                           living in a quarry.

                           I know, but you have to try and 
                           stay awake.

                           I’m starving too. Can we have room 
                           service?

                           No room service here, I’m afraid. 
                           I’ll go and get something. Who 
                           wants pizza!

                PATRICK, carrying a brown bag of groceries, stands in front 
                of the DRAKE HOTEL - the location of his epic breakdown in 
                ‘Bad News.’ He hesitates. He really should head back -
        73      INT. LOBBY, DRAKE HOTEL, NEW YORK 2003 - DAY               73
                Inside, it’s all exactly as before; money, comfort, luxury, 
                privilege. Even the sinister BELLBOY is there, along with the 
                same RECEPTIONIST.
                                       RECEPTIONIST

                           Not this time. Just...meeting a 
                           friend in the bar.
        74      INT. BAR, DRAKE HOTEL, NEW YORK 2003 - DAY                 74
                PATRICK sits at the bar, the sack of groceries by his side, 
                draining his glass. 
                                       PATRICK

                He looks around, suddenly out of place, a middle-aged man 
                weighed down by groceries. The second drink is accompanied by 
                the cheque; he laughs at the price, downs the whiskey, pokes 
                in his wallet for the money.
        75      INT. CORRIDOR, THE CROWN MIDTOWN, NEW YORK 2003 - NIGHT    75
                And now, drunk, with groceries in one hand, take-away pizzas 
                in the other, he staggers back to the room - 
        76      INT. HOTEL ROOM, THE CROWN MIDTOWN, NEW YORK 2003 - NIGHT 76
                - and bursts in with manic good cheer, into an atmosphere of 
                palpable tension. He has been gone too long, ROBERT is weepy, 
                MARY worried and angry (while THOMAS sleeps next door.) 
                                       PATRICK
                           Sorry sorry sorry, had to walk 
                           miles. Here - pizza!

                           No oats that taste of oats or 
                           apples that taste of apples, only 
                           oats that taste of apples-

                                  drained. ROBERT sees 
                                  this, PATRICK sees him 
                                  seeing)
                           - and cinnamon of course, to go 
                           with the toothpaste. 
                He ruffles ROBERT’s hair, but he shrugs this off. MARY sees 
                this, and the look of sadness it provokes. 
                Meanwhile the pizzas, leaking grease onto the carpet, are 
                hopeless and cold. 
                                       MARY
                           Goodness, aren’t they big! No 
                           knives, we’ll have to just...tear 
                           at them.

                           Christ. Thick as a nappy. Sorry 
                           about that. I ordered the special, 
                           but what is this? Is 
                           this...pineapple?
                                 (ROBERT is unbearably 
                                  sad)
                           Hey, hey Robert - what’s wrong?

                                       MARY
                           We’re all exhausted. Let’s start 
                           the holiday again tomorrow, shall 
                           we?
                In the next room, THOMAS starts to cry. PATRICK slumps.

                           Are you sure this is alright?
                                       PATRICK (V.O.)
                           Of course. She was very keen on the 
                           phone. We can stay as long as we

                And the countryside, finally pulling up at a handsome house 
                set in beautiful grounds. A man stands and waves from the 
                porch; sleek, self-satisfied, pompous but not unkind.
                                       PATRICK2
                           Oh, God. She’s invited Henry.

                           NANCY1’s cousin. He got all the 
                           money, which makes NANCY1 furious. 
                           Whatever you do, don’t talk about 
                           politics. He’s a nice man, but 
                           pretty much a fascist. 
                                       MARY2
                           Oh good.
                NANCY2, ELEANOR2’s younger sister, joins him, looking a little 
                less enthusiastic.

                They get out of the car. The Melrose family suddenly feel 
                distinctly shabby.

                           There’s a games room, a cinema, a

                           and the ticks are just dreadful 
                           this year, the poison ivy too. It

                           a Cambodian swamp.  Best to assume 
                           you’re always in danger.

                           ROBERT2! Thomas! Shall we go for a 
                           swim?
                                       PATRICK2
                           I’ll go get the costumes.

                           I’ll come with you. We need to talk

                PATRICK2 slams the car boot shut, heaves the cases inside.

                - and scatters clothes as he searches for the swimming 
                costumes.

                PATRICK sits impatiently with swimming costumes in his lap as 
                NANCY flicks furiously through an auction catalogue.
                                       NANCY2
                           So many things, so many lovely 
                           things, all stolen. A world class 
                           fortune, gone.
                                 (the catalogue)
                           These - these were ours! Made for 
                           Napoleon. They used to just sit on 
                           the terrace in the rain. A million 
                           and a half dollars, that’s what my 
                           little stepbrother got for Mummy’s 
                           garden tubs. Wouldn’t you like to 
                           have some of these for your 
                           children?
                                       PATRICK2
                           I would but it’s a little late for 
                           that now.

                           Poor Patrick. I know exactly how 
                           you must feel. 
                                       PATRICK2
                                 (a bitter laugh)
                           You seem to be doing just fine 
                           here, NANCY2. 
                                       NANCY2
                           This place? Believe me, this is 
                           nothing to what we should have had -
                                       PATRICK2
                           Shall we talk about ELEANOR1?
                                 (he sits with her)
                           There’s really no improvement, or 
                           hope of improvement. ELEANOR1’s aware of 
                           this and has asked me to kill her. 
                                       NANCY2
                           Oh, PATRICK2! That’s not fair, 
                           that’s really not fair! 
                                       PATRICK2
                           I have no doubt that helping her to 
                           die would be the most loving thing 
                           I could do. 
                                       NANCY2
                           Well maybe...maybe you should rent 
                           an ambulance and drive her to 
                           Holland. 
                                       PATRICK2
                           Arriving in Holland isn’t in itself 
                           fatal. 
                                       NANCY2
                           PATRICK2, please! Let’s not talk 
                           about this any more, it’s too 
                           upsetting. 
                                       PATRICK2
                           Fine, but I haven’t told MARY1, so -

                           Goodness, why haven’t you told her?
                                       PATRICK2
                           In case it’s a good idea.
                MARY2 arrives.

                           I don’t suppose you’d like a drink 
                           before dinner?
                                       NANCY2
                           Oh, I don’t drink. Didn’t you know? 
                           I watched it destroy Daddy’s life. 
                           But you help yourself.  
                A moment. MARY looks at the floor.

                           Later perhaps.

                DAY
                A little later, and PATRICK2 is sneaking away from the family 
                group, checking to see no-one has noticed. Furtive, urgent.
        87      INT. DRAWING ROOM, THE MANSION, CONNECTICUT 2003 - DAY     87
                He wears long swimming shorts, still damp, and a shirt, and 
                is searching for the drinks tray -
                                       PATRICK2
                           There you are!
                He goes to pour a glass of whisky then, not wanting to dirty 
                the glass, decides to take a swig from the bottle. 
                The sound of the children playing. He should join them.
                But the bottle; the level is lower than expected. 
                                       PATRICK2 (CONT’D)
                           Damn.
                Perhaps he could water it down? No water. Think!
                He takes another swig - looks around for somewhere to hide 
                the evidence -

                He hurries outside, stashing the empty bottle in a bush on 
                the way to the rental car, where he fumbles the keys, drops 
                them, climbs in. Ding-ding-ding - safety belt not on. He 
                starts the engine.
        90      EXT. DRIVEWAY, THE MANSION, CONNECTICUT 2003 - DAY         90
                Ding-ding-ding. Heading for the entrance, driving a little 
                too fast, the car on the left side of the road. A swerve. The 
                car on the right side of the road. 
        91      INT/EXT. CAR/ROAD, CONNECTICUT 2003 - DAY                  91
                PATRICK is driving much, much too fast. Ding-ding-ding. To 
                drown out the noise he turns the radio on. American Rock 
                Anthems. He shouts and whoops along - 
        92      EXT. CAR PARK, LIQUOR STORE, CONNECTICUT 2003 - DAY        92
                - and sprays gravel in the forecourt of the Vino Veritas 
                Liquor Store. Ding-ding-ding. He stumbles from the car and 
                runs inside.
        93      INT/EXT. CAR/CAR PARK, LIQUOR STORE, CONNECTICUT 2003 - DAY93
                Three bottles of booze in a brown paper bag are dumped onto 
                the passenger seat. Suddenly the business of driving seems 
                entirely beyond him.
                He looks at his watch, looks around him. A pay-phone.
        94      EXT. CAR PARK, LIQUOR STORE, CONNECTICUT 2003 - DAY        94
                PATRICK2 pumps coins into the phone. The murmur of JULIA1’s 
                answering machine. He pours whisky into a take-out coffee 
                cup.
                                       PATRICK2
                           JULIA1, it’s PATRICK2. Are you hiding 
                           behind your machine? Ah well.  
                The shaking hand, the slurred speech - he’s heading back to 
                the bottom. He starts to cry.
                                       PATRICK2 (CONT’D)
                           Feel a little in freefall here. I 
                           wanted a friendly voice. Ah well. I

                PATRICK replaces the bottle. Gathers himself. Impossibly 
                drunk. Still wearing shorts.

                MARY, NANCY and COUSIN HENRY; sleek, self-satisfied, pompous 
                but not unkind. ROBERT sits, bored. THOMAS plays with toy 
                cars on the floor.

                           call the police!

                           There’s a slobbering thought. I’m 
                           so sorry, I had a sudden yen to see 
                           the countryside. Sobering. Did I 
                           say slobbering?  I meant sobering. 
                He takes his seat unsteadily. This is the drunkest we’ve seen 
                him, and NANCY2 is mortified, MARY is furious. ROBERT2 is 
                frightened - he has never quite seen this state before - and 
                the air of tension is increased by THOMAS burbling away.

                           I was just saying how tired the

                PATRICK2 winces, reaches for the wine. MARY2 - ‘don’t.’

                           used to have. My grandfather had a 
                           150-acre garden on Long Island. I’m 
                           not talking about the woods and 
                           fields, a garden -

                           I was recalling Pearl Harbour. When 
                           Admiral Yamamoto had finished his 
                           attack, he said ‘Gentlemen, we have 
                           roused a sleeping giant - ’
                And during the above, PATRICK2 reaches for the wine. MARY2 
                touches his hand - no, please no more - but he pours it all 
                the same, and all the while THOMAS’s noise gets louder.

                           ...and it is this thought that 
                           should be in the mind of the 
                           world’s terrorists and their state 
                           sponsors.

                           Are you familiar with the phrase 
                           ‘children should be seen not 
                           heard?’
                A beat, then MARY2 bridles.
                                       MARY2
                           Of course. I think it’s nonsense.
                                       NANCY2
                           For my part, I’ve always thought it 
                           was entirely too liberal. 
                                       MARY2
                                 (laughing, appalled)
                           You’d rather not see him either? 
                           Fine.
                MARY2 stands and takes ROBERT2 and THOMAS to the door. ROBERT2 
                is visibly upset at his father’s state.
                                       PATRICK
                           Christ, NANCY2, you sound just like 
                           DAVID1.
                                       NANCY2
                           PATRICK2, we’re just trying to 
                           extend some hospitality -
      Patrick Melrose - 'Mother's Milk' - Ep 4                             52
                                       PATRICK2
                           Oh we just po’ white trash, 
                           throwing oursef on the charitee of 
                           our American kin.
                                       HENRY
                           You don’t have to accept it, if you 
                           don’t want to.
                                       PATRICK2
                           You’re right, we don’t. 
                MARY stands in the doorway. ‘Not again...’
                                       MARY2
                           But we’d like to.
                                       PATRICK2
                           Speak for yourself.
                                       MARY2
                           I am! And I’m also trying to speak 
                           for our children.
                                       PATRICK2
                           You’re not even speaking for 
                           yourself! ‘Entirely too liberal!’? 
                           I mean, fuck off!
        100     INT. BEDROOM, THE MANSION, CONNECTICUT 2003 - NIGHT       100
                Later. MARY packs their suitcases while PATRICK, a little 
                more sober and ashamed now, stands in the doorway.
                                       MARY2
                           Less than twenty-four hours.
                                       PATRICK2
                           A new personal best.
                                       MARY2
                           Hardly worth unpacking. 
                                       PATRICK2
                                 (THOMAS on the bed)
                           You’re safely installed with your 
                           lover, I see.
                                       MARY2
                           I’ll move him to one side. 
                            PATRICK2                      MARY2 (CONT'D)                        *
                No, God forbid you should let    Lower your voice. Lower your                 **
                one drop, one tiny drop of       voice -                                      *
                love and affection escape 
                from the children - 
      Patrick Melrose - 'Mother's Milk' - Ep 4                             53
                                       MARY2 (CONT’D)
                           You’re right! I’ve no love or 
                           affection when you’re like this. 
                                       PATRICK2
                           And the rest of the time? 
                                       MARY2
                                 (she laughs)
                           The ‘rest of the time’? 
                She sits. Quietly, calmly - THOMAS is right there.
                                       MARY2 (CONT'D)
                           I think you ought to know; I’ve 
                           started to imagine life without 
                           you PATRICK2. Any compassion or patience I 
                           might have had, it’s all dried up - 
                           and it’s not just the drinking, or 
                           this demeaning...thing with JULIA1 - 
                           demeaning to you as much as me - or 
                           the mindless destruction. It’s the 
                           way the children are involved. That 
                           thing NANCY1 said, about watching 
                           her father destroy his life. It’s 
                           what ROBERT1 saw this evening -
                                 (PATRICK2 knows this too)
                           - and yet you don’t stop. If you 
                           can’t change, you have to go. 
                                       PATRICK2
                           I see. Would you like me to go now?
                                       MARY2
                           Yes, please. 
                                 (goes back to packing)
                           At least there are plenty of spare 
                           bedrooms. 
        101     INT/EXT. CAR/DRIVEWAY, THE MANSION, CONNECTICUT 2003 - DAY101
                The rental car is driving away. No-one waves goodbye. Inside, 
                a barely suppressed atmosphere of anger and embarrassment -
        102     INT/EXT. CAR/BACK ROADS, CONNECTICUT 2003 - DAY           102
                Heading back to New York. PATRICK2 checks behind - the kids 
                aren’t listening. In a low voice -  
                                       PATRICK2
                           I didn’t want to tell you while we 
                           were on holiday. And it’s not an 
                           excuse. ELEANOR1 has asked me to 
                           kill her. To help her die.
      Patrick Melrose - 'Mother's Milk' - Ep 4                             54
                                       MARY2
                           I see. I’m sorry.
                                 (she takes this in)
                           God.
                And they drive on in silence.
        103     EXT. THE CROWN MIDTOWN, NEW YORK 2003 - DAY               103
                And wearily, once again unload their bags outside the hotel - 
        104     INT. CORRIDOR, THE CROWN MIDTOWN, NEW YORK 2003 - DAY     104
                - and head down an identical corridor to their room. 
        105     INT. HOTEL ROOM, THE CROWN MIDTOWN, NEW YORK 2003 - NIGHT105
                Grocery bags, take-out cartons. THOMAS already asleep under 
                the sheets. ROBERT looks through the door at his father, 
                lying on the floor in front of the sofa bed, channel hopping. 
                MARY watches too, the news about ELEANOR still with her. Not 
                forgiveness exactly, but a sense of understanding. Quietly - 
                                       MARY2
                           Why don’t you go and sit with your 
                           PATRICK2. Watch TV. He’d like that.
                ROBERT2’s about to approach, but now PATRICK2 opens a miniature 
                of whisky, pours it, knocks back a pill, then becomes aware 
                of ROBERT’s presence. He shows the tiny bottle to ROBERT.
                                       PATRICK2
                           I’m cutting down.
                                 (He tries a smile. 
                                  ROBERT2 smiles back. 
                                  With open arms)
                           Come and say goodnight.
                                       ROBERT2
                                 (remaining in the 
                                  doorway)
                           Goodnight then.
                And ROBERT closes the door. PATRICK watches, and remembers - 
        105A    INT. HALLWAY, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 1967 - NIGHT          105A
                - YOUNG PATRICK walking down the corridor, late at night, 
                pushing at his mother’s door - 
      Patrick Melrose - 'Mother's Milk' - Ep 4                             55
        105B    INT. ELEANOR’S ROOM, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 1967 - CONTINUOUS105B
                - ELEANOR is awake. She sees YOUNG PATRICK and smiles, throws 
                back the sheet. He climbs in and she pulls him close. 
        106     INT. HOTEL ROOM, THE CROWN MIDTOWN, NEW YORK 2003 - NIGHT106
                Lying on the floor, PATRICK hears the laughter through the 
                walls.
                He turns on the TV, turns the volume up. Channel hops, the 
                channels changing faster, faster -
                CUT TO BLACK.
                END OF PART FOUR                                                *
