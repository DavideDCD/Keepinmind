                           I’ll leave you now. But know one 
                           thing. If you ever tell your 
                           ELEANOR1, or anyone else, about 
                           today, I will snap you in two.

                PATRICK’s West London flat. 
        2       INT. BEDROOM, ENNISMORE GARDENS, LONDON 1990 - DAWN         2
                PATRICK MELROSE lies awake towards the end of another 
                sleepless night. On his bedside table -
                - the green lizard, the GECKO. Tongue flicking, it squats on 
                the pile of books by his bedside, and PATRICK watches it 
                quite calmly before -
                - sitting, rousing himself, blinking the hallucination away. 
                In his thirties now, PATRICK is healthier, less chaotic and 
                self-destructive but pale, ill-at-ease as if newly released 
                from prison (or a psychiatric ward, or rehab, as is the 
                case). You’d be hard-pressed to say that sobriety has brought 
                health and happiness. By the bedside - anti-depressants and 
                sleeping pills. PROZAC perhaps.
                He dresses. Routine. 
        3       INT. HALLWAY, ENNISMORE GARDENS, LONDON 1990 - DAWN         3
                In the hallway, mail on the doorstep. He picks it up, adds it 
                to the thick pile of unopened envelopes.

                The kettle boils. PATRICK watches, head resting against the 
                cupboard. He pours water on the tea bag, adds one, two, three 
                teaspoonfuls of sugar. Too much? He taps some back -
                - and spills some granules on the work-top. He crushes the 
                grains with the back of his teaspoon then, using the edge of 
                it, he crunches the powdered sugar into A NEAT LINE.
                A moment. 
                Then he brushes the crystalline white powder into his hand 
                and tosses it into the sink. MUSIC CONTINUES -

                C.U. - books, legal textbooks, thick and dull - ‘Street on 
                Tort’, ‘Charlesworth on Negligence’, ‘The Concept of 
                Justice’.
                But PATRICK is laying on the sofa, watching day-time TV. 
                Videos scatter the floor. The sun is shining on the screen. 
                He stands and draws the curtains. Sits. Surveys the room - 
                the mess, the claustrophobia. A spasm of self-loathing at the 
                drabness of it all. 
                The sound of a door bell. He freezes. The bell sounds again. 
                Genuine alarm from PATRICK -

                And now here is CHEATLEY, the fine stately home of Lord and 
                Lady Gravesend. A sweeping drive, an ornamental lake in the 
                misty light. 
                Framed by a window, BRIDGET WATSON-SCOTT, NICHOLAS PRATT’s 
                Chelsea girlfriend in ‘Never Mind’
                But now she is Lady Gravesend, early-forties, surveying the 
                view with dissatisfaction. She wears her dressing-gown, tea 
                in one hand, cigarette in the other. She seems pinched, 
                tense, the clear blue-eyes clouded over as she glowers 
                unhappily at the makeshift marquee that now mars the rear 
                vista.

                with breakfast and the newspapers.
                                     SONNY2
                           Darling, what’s all this in 
                           Dempster this morning? ‘Two hundred 
                           guests, ten thousand acres, party 
                           of the year’. It sounds as if we’re 
                           made of money! I told you not to 
                           talk to the press!
                                     BRIDGET2
                           I didn’t talk to the press!
                                     SONNY2
                           ‘”I’m just having a few friends 
                           round to celebrate my husband’s 
                           birthday” says Lady BRIDGET2.

                           Frankly I wish I hadn’t bothered. 
                           It’s so grey out there! If it was 
                           May or June, we could be out on the 
                           big lawn, but in November -

                           One can’t choose when one’s born -
                                     BRIDGET2
                           No. It’s extremely aggravating. 
                           I’ve asked Tony to come early and
                           brighten it up -

                           That appalling little man shouldn’t 
                           be coming at all.

                SONNY2 collapses back onto the pillows and, when the coast is 
                clear, picks up the phone - a chunky wireless model. He 
                dials.

        12      INT. HALLWAY, ENNISMORE GARDENS, LONDON 1990 - MORNING     12
                The doorbell rings persistently. The door is on a chain.  
                PATRICK opens it a little -
                                     PATRICK2
                           Hello?
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           Why haven’t you replied to BRIDGET2?
                           You simply must come. Open this 
                           door!
                No way out. PATRICK2 opens the door, and NICHOLAS2 rushes in -
        13      INT. LIVING ROOM, ENNISMORE GARDENS, LONDON 1990 - CONTINUOUS13
                NICHOLAS flicks through the unopened mail as PATRICK tries to 
                make it respectable. 
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           Do you have any idea how hard it 
                           was to get you invited in the first 
                           place?
                                     PATRICK2
                           I’m very grateful, but I don’t feel 
                           ready for the world just yet.

                               (he finds the invitation, 
                                bustles next door)
                           Why are these curtains drawn? 
                               (he pulls them open and 
                                inspects the room)
                           Better than a psychiatric ward, I 
                           suppose. Theoretically. I need a 
                           drink. Do you have a drink, a 
                           proper drink?
                                     PATRICK2
                           That’s what put me in the ward. I 
                           can offer you herbal tea.
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           Don’t be absurd. You might at least 
                           open a window, or step outside once 
                           in a while. And ELEANOR1, too, 
                           she’s almost as reclusive as you 
                           are.
                                     PATRICK2
                           It’s amazing, isn’t it? She seems 
                           to think there are better things to 
                           do than go to parties.

                           Yes, I always thought she was a 
                           little peculiar. Where is ELEANOR1? 
                                     PATRICK2
                           As far as I know she’s driving a 
                           consignment of ten thousand 
                           syringes to Poland. People say it’s 
                           marvellous of her, but I still 
                           think charity begins at home. I 
                           wish she’d bring them round here.
                A moment, then NICHOLAS2 sighs. More serious now.
                                     NICHOLAS
                           I thought all that was behind you. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           Behind me, in front of me, who 
                           knows? 
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           You’re being very melodramatic 
                           today.
                                     PATRICK2
                           Well, I’ve realised that I’ve given 
                           up everything and taken up nothing.
      Patrick Melrose - 'Some Hope' - Ep3                                  6
                                     NICHOLAS2
                               (the law books)
                           I thought you were going to ‘work 
                           for a living’?
                                     PATRICK2
                           That’s the intention. In fact, it’s 
                           a necessity after the medical 
                           bills. But I still feel rather as 
                           if life - 
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           That’s enough. Sit down, please.
                               (taken aback, PATRICK2 does 
                                so)
                           Offended as I am by the very idea 
                           of a ‘pep talk’ I’m left with no 
                           choice. You can’t rot in this 
                           hovel. Quite apart from how 
                           depressing it all is, I owe it to 
                           your dear papa to get you back in 
                           the swim of things -
                                     PATRICK2
                           The worry is, NICHOLAS2, that I 
                           might drown -
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           Nonsense. Pull yourself together, 
                           find something to wear, and if you 
                           must talk about ‘life’, you can do 
                           so at the party. I’m sure someone 
                           will listen to you.
                               (leaving)
                           I’ll reply to BRIDGET2 on your 
                           behalf. 
                               (handing over the invite)
                           And remember, it’s a party, you’re 
                           not meant to enjoy it.

                BRIDGET2 certainly isn’t enjoying it as she stands and frets 
                amidst FLOWER ARRANGERS, CATERERS, TECHNICIANS, all bustling 
                around the huge space.
                TONY FOWLES, trusted friend, is taking control.

                           Now, I know what you’re thinking, 
                           not enough colour. Which is why 
                           I’ve bought you these - 
                               (his assistants bring 
                                large boxes)
                           I thought tents, I thought poles, I 
                           thought ribbons, I thought maypoles

                           Wonderful. Um - how much?

                                     BRIDGET2
                           I see. Sorry, what’s the dreaded? 
                                     TONY FOWLES
                               (mouthing)
                           V.A.T.
                                     BRIDGET2
                           Goodness. 
                A little way off, a small GIRL, BELINDA, 7, is being shouted 
                at by a ferocious Scottish NANNY.
                             NANNY                     BRIDGET2 (CONT'D)
                You’re a naughty, naughty        Oh, dear. I do wish Nanny 
                girl! Running out here,          wasn’t quite so horrid to 
                without a coat. You’re a         Belinda.
                nuisance to me and a burden 
                to your parents.
                                     TONY FOWLES
                           Well, why don’t you just sack the 
                           old hag? 
                                     BRIDGET2
                           She’s terrifying. Tony, just...make 
                           it better, will you?
                And BRIDGET crosses to NANNY and her DAUGHTER. NANNY 
                brandishes a walkie-talkie in BELINDA’s face.
                                     NANNY
                           Where did you get this? Tell me! 
                           Where? Did you steal it? Did you?
                                     BRIDGET2
                           I’m sure she didn’t steal it, 
                           Nanny. One of the security men will 
                           have lost it. Here - 
                               (the walkie-talkie)
                           I’ll find who it belongs to.
                                     BELINDA
                           And mummy, will you come and play?

                                     NANNY
                           Your mother is much, much too busy 
                           to play with the likes of you!
                                     BRIDGET2
                           Maybe later, darling. 
                And she walks on towards the house, pressing buttons on the 
                walkie-talkie...
                                     BRIDGET2 (CONT’D)
                           Hello? Can anyone hear me? I have 
                           your walkie...
                A click, a buzz, feedback, then through the static, Sonny’s 
                voice - 
                                     SONNY1 (O.C.)
                           Of course I’ll tell her! But it can 
                           hardly be tonight after all the 
                           work BRIDGET2’s put in...
                The sound fades into static. Frantic, BRIDGET2 shakes the 
                walkie-talkie, turns dials, the voice comes back -
                                     SONNY1 (CONT’D)
                           Let’s not think about that now, my 
                           love...
                Confused, dazed, she looks up at the beautiful house. In the 
                bedroom, SONNY1 is on the wireless phone, his back to the 
                window.

                           ...the main thing is I’ll get to 
                           see you in the flesh, even if it’s 
                           just a glimpse.
        16      EXT. GROUNDS, CHEATLEY, THE COTSWOLDS 1990 - CONTINUOUS    16
                Click, buzz, the voices have gone. BRIDGET stands, dumb-
                founded as around her caterers, florists, musicians, security 
                guards and bartenders prepare for the party of the decade. 
                Her hand hangs loosely by her side.
                A world starting to crumble.
                The sound of a phone ringing -

        17      INT. JOHNNY2 HALL’S FLAT, NOTTING HILL, LONDON 1990 - MORNING17
                JOHNNY HALL, too, is clean now, though he seems to be a 
                little better at it than PATRICK1. As the phone rings on, he’s 
                in bed with JULIA2, PATRICK1’s secret girlfriend from ‘Bad 
                News’, now JULIA2 BROGILE. 
                                     JULIA2
                           Who is that d’you think?
                               (ringing continues)
                           Aren’t you going to answer?
                                     JOHNNY2
                               (the answering machine 
                                clicks on)
                           Not this second -
                PATRICK1 sounds manic.
                                     PATRICK1 (O.S.)
                           This party tonight, BRIDGET1’s 
                           party, I need you to come as my 
                           guest. I’m ready to leave the 
                           house. Am I ready? Almost certainly 
                           not - 
                                     JULIA2
                           PATRICK1! Go and answer!
                He sighs, pads towards the phone as PATRICK1 rattles on - 
                                     PATRICK1 (O.S.)
                           Debbie will be there, Christ, 
                           Debbie who hates me and who I 
                           should apologise to and can’t, at 
                           least not without drugs, which is 
                           the very thing I need to apologise 
                           for, and JULIA2, God, JULIA2! -

                PATRICK1 is emptying out his wardrobe, searching its depths

                the door. Apparently, I have                                                          *

                           Well I hate to agree with NICHOLAS1 
                           Pratt, but perhaps he’s right.

                           I’ll need your help. Can you drive 
                           me down? 
                                     JOHNNY2
                           Of course, but I have to go to my 
                           meeting first. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           What meeting? Oh, that meeting. I 
                           don’t know how you put up with 
                           those things. Aren’t they full of 
                           ghastly people?
                                     JOHNNY2
                               (heading back to JULIA)
                           Isn’t any crowded room? 
                                     PATRICK2
                           Which is why I mustn’t go to this 
                           party!
                                     JOHNNY2
                           Three o’clock. I’ll see you there. 
                           It’s open to everyone, by the way.
                And JOHNNY2 hangs up. JULIA2 waits, a little too expectantly.
                                     JULIA2
                           PATRICK1 Melrose. He’ll be fun.
                                     JOHNNY2
                           I wouldn’t count on it. 
                                     JULIA2
                           Have you told him about us?
                                     JOHNNY2
                           No, you told me not to. Have you?

                           I haven’t seen PATRICK1 for ages. 
                           Did he ask about me?

                               (kissing again)
                           He said he’s very much looking 
                           forward to meeting your husband. So 
                           am I.

                Weekend bag packed, PATRICK2 stands ready to leave the house. 
                But there’s still something of the agoraphobic’s anxiety to 
                the act. He puts on sunglasses, for protection.

                BRIDGET2 too. Hands shaking, she takes a Valium and washes it 
                down with a glass of champagne.

                A minicab stops on the imposing gravel driveway of Cheatley; 
                VIRGINIA2 WATSON-SCOTT, 65, BRIDGET1’s mother, in her best 
                dress and coat but still out of place. Flustered, she pokes 
                around in her purse.

                SONNY2, meanwhile, has made a rare trip to the nursery, where 
                THE NANNY is reading a story in a dour monotone.
                                     SONNY2
                           How is my favourite girl?

                           busy day like this!
                                     SONNY2
                           So - what are we reading?
                                     BELINDA
                               (’The Secret Staircase’)
                           This one.
                BRIDGET2, stunned and numb, watches from the doorway.
                                     SONNY2
                           But you’ve just read it. Why would 
                           you want to hear it again?
                                     BELINDA
                           Please, Dada, it’s my favourite. 
                                     SONNY2
                           Very well. ‘For many generations, 
                           families of mice have made their

                           the trees in Brambly Hedge...’

                Instant coffee is spooned into plastic cups and a great urn 
                of tea is rolled into place. A rundown community centre. 
                There’s lots of chatter, laughter, embracing, a convivial 
                atmosphere even if JOHNNY2 is a little self-conscious and 
                disconnected, taking a seat at the back of the circle of 
                chairs. The Secretary, HARRY -

                PATRICK2 carries a small overnight bag, his suit on a hanger,

                           Someone told me recovery was about 
                           learning to put your tie round your 
                           neck instead of your arm. That’s 
                           easy, I thought, I can do that...

                - we follow PATRICK2 as he approaches the meeting room.
                In the room, PETER is skinny, wired, as nervous as PATRICK2, 
                who sits now.

                           ...but when I was using, I found it 
                           easy to cross the road because I 
                           genuinely didn’t care if I was run 
                           over or not. Now I’m in recovery 
                           I’m fucking terrified. I walk for 
                           miles for a zebra crossing - 
                               (PATRICK2 sits forward)
                           Just this morning I found myself 
                           chopping out lines of Colman’s 
                           Mustard Powder. Little neat lines.
                               (Laughter. Recognition

                           I make tea, and I find myself 
                           worrying that I’ve put too much 
                           sugar in the spoon, I watch TV and 
                           I start to think I’m controlling 
                           it. I couldn’t watch it last night 
                           ‘cos I was worried I was putting 
                           the weatherman off by staring at 
                           him. So sometimes I think, fuck it, 
                           what’s the point, just start using 
                           again, what’s to stop you? Is 
                           saying this out loud meant to help 
                           somehow? Am I meant to feel better 
                           now? I don’t know. Anyway. Thanks.

                           too... 
                PATRICK2 has sunk in the chair, touched by JOHNNY2’s sincerity. 
                From AMANDA, at the front - 
                                     AMANDA
                           I’m going too! Hi Johnny!
                                     JOHNNY2
                           Anyway, it’s a big party and I just 
                           feel under threat I suppose. So I 
                           just wanted to reaffirm my desire 
                           to stay clean today, and hopefully 
                           keep my friend clean too. Thanks. 
                                     GROUP
                           Thanks, Johnny. 
                And JOHNNY2 sits down, relieved. 
                At the back of the room, PATRICK2 takes this in, his cynicism 
                suppressed, for now at least. 
                                     HARRY
                           Thanks, Johnny. Now before we 
                           finish it’s newcomer time, 
                           newcomers only, please. Anyone?
                JOHNNY2 looks around the room and sees PATRICK2 for the first 
                time. 
                PATRICK2 snaps into his impervious manner, shrugs, taps his 
                watch. JOHNNY2 turns back, smiles -

                We follow PATRICK2 into the corridor, where he fumbles for a 
                cigarette, shaken.

                AFTERNOON
                JOHNNY2 and AMANDA are stacking chairs.
                                     AMANDA
                           I knew you were talking about 
                           Cheatley! Is it true that PATRICK1 
                           Melrose is coming? Because I’m not 
                           sure it’s good for people like us 
                           to be around that kind of 
                           negativity - 
                                     JOHNNY2
                           And here he is!
                                     AMANDA
                           Hello, PATRICK2! Nice to see you out 
                           and about.
                                     JOHNNY2
                           Amanda was just wondering if you 
                           were coming to the party.
                                     PATRICK2
                           You know I think I might!
                                     AMANDA
                           Great! I’ll see you there! I may 
                           need you for an emergency meeting!
                                     JOHNNY2
                           I’ll feel safer knowing you’re 
                           there.
                She leaves. PATRICK2 narrows his eyes.
                                     PATRICK2
                           She’s not an addict, she just likes 
                           a bit of coke. Amateur!
                               (while JOHNNY2 stacks 
                                chairs)
                           Honestly, I don’t know how you 
                           stand it. The slogans, all that 
                           fatuous jargon - 
                                     JOHNNY2
                           That’s not a reason to hope they 
                           fail.

                                     PATRICK2
                           I don’t hope they fail! I just 
                           don’t know how anyone can bear the 
                           hypocrisy. 
                                     JOHNNY2
                           They have a slogan for that too. 
                           ‘Fake it to make it.’
                                     PATRICK2
                           Christ, it’s worse than I thought.
                                     JOHNNY2
                           It’s just a place to confess.
                                     PATRICK2
                           Fine, if you confess the thing that 
                           matters and people never do. 
                                     JOHNNY2
                           Even so, if it helps to say these 
                           things out loud - 
                                     PATRICK2
                           But it’s so unnecessary!
                                     JOHNNY2
                           Why? Don’t you find it hard not to 
                           take drugs?
                                     PATRICK2
                           Of course, it’s a fucking 
                           nightmare, being lucid.
                                     PATRICK2 (CONT’D)
                           My inner-life, JOHNNY2, is an 
                           endless reel of decapitations and 
                           dogs fighting over the liver I 
                           quite want back thank you very 
                           much. Oblivion would be wonderful, 
                           if I didn’t have this horror of 
                           forgetting.

                Two hours to go. VIRGINIA2 and BELINDA are playing happily as 
                BRIDGET2 and TONY return, dressed now for the evening.
                                     BELINDA
                               (a bag of sweets)
                           Look what VIRGINIA2 bought me! Would 
                           you like one?
                                     BRIDGET2
                           You mustn’t give her sweets. 
                           They’re very bad for her teeth.
                           VIRGINIA2 disapproves terribly, don’t 
                           you, Nanny?

                           Yes, I do. What are we talking 
                           about?
                               (Seeing the sweets)

                NANNY sets off in pursuit.

                           Perhaps she could just have one or 
                           two after dinner.

                           You don’t mind, do you? We thought 
                           it’d be nicer, more relaxed, at 
                           their dinner table. Then you can 
                           come later to the big party, the 
                           exciting bit -

                           No, no, that sounds very nice. Will 
                           you excuse me, I must just -
                And she heads out, tugging the paper tissue from her cardigan 
                sleeve, struggling to hide her hurt.

                           What on earth makes you say that?

                           She looked sad when she left.

      Patrick Melrose - 'Some Hope' - Ep3                                 20
                A flowered duvet on twin beds too close together, a chintzy 
                cell. PATRICK, half-dressed, boils the kettle, spoons sugar 
                into the cup. Too much in the spoon?
                He picks up the Hotel brochure - a lurid picture of a 
                bleeding rib of beef. ‘Dine in our famous Cotswold 
                Carvery...’

                           ‘Book early to avoid 
                           disappointment.’ Hm.
                He channel-hops, quick flashes, perhaps a moment of ‘Zulu’. 
                The inanities of local news, the TV WEATHERMAN talking 
                straight at him. PATRICK2 glares back at the TV. He wonders - 
                is he putting him off?

                           We’ve had a fairly bright pleasant 
                           afternoon, 4 or 5 degrees, but as 
                           night falls so will those 
                           temperatures. Nothing unusual for 
                           this time of year, and it’s going 
                           to be a dry night but with 
                           temperatures of one or two degrees 
                           in central regions. Tomorrow, we’re 
                           looking at mist and fog but still 
                           no rain, at least not until the 
                           weekend and then we really will see 
                           a change...
                PART 3 PATRICK2’S HOTEL ROOM 
                He snaps off the TV, hurls himself back onto the bed. The 
                Gecko here perhaps? But memories of the past, other hotel 
                rooms -  
                                     DAVID2 (V.O.)
                           Good God, what an appalling dump. 
                           You see what I’m reduced to?
        35      INT. HOTEL ROOM, PROVENCE 1968 - DAY                       35
                Mediterranean light. Twin beds too close together. DAVID2 
                MELROSE inspects the hotel room. This is shortly after his 
                divorce - no beard yet, but a redness to the eyes, stubble - 
                the beginning of the decline. 
                                     DAVID2
                           Your mother will be delighted. I 
                           can see her gloating, when you 
                           report back.

                YOUNG PATRICK2 is behind him with the suitcases, nervous, 
                sweating, his TEN YEAR-OLD SELF.
                                     DAVID2 (CONT’D)
                           Do you report back?
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                               (he shakes his head)
                           Perhaps we could find somewhere 
                           else. Perhaps we could - 
                                     DAVID2
                           No, but we must live within our 
                           means! This will do. Now - 
                               (the beds)
                           -left or right? 
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                           Don’t mind. 
                DAVID2 sits wearily, and removes his shoes. 
                YOUNG PATRICK2 is shaking, terrified, doing all he can not to 
                run from the room. 
                                     DAVID2
                           I’m a very tired man. Come and talk 
                           to me, PATRICK2. 
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                           I have to -
                                     DAVID2
                           PATRICK2. Come and talk to your dear 
                           old dad. Please.
                                     YOUNG PATRICK2
                           I’m going to the bathroom.
                A moment. Then - 
                                     DAVID2
                           Well. Don’t be long.
                The bathroom door closes on DAVID2.
        36      INT. HOTEL BATHROOM, THE CAMARGUE, PROVENCE 1968 - DAY     36
                YOUNG PATRICK2 paces, tearful, fists clenching and 
                unclenching, muttering to himself. 
                                     DAVID2 (O.S.)
                           PATRICK2? PATRICK2, where are you?
                           PATRICK2!

                There’s no escape, no alternative. Hand trembling, YOUNG 
                PATRICK2 opens the door. DAVID2 waits on the bed - 
                                                             HARD CUT TO -
        37      INT. HOTEL ROOM, LITTLE SODDINGTON HOTEL 1990 - EVENING    37
                The same fear - panicked breathing. PATRICK2 grabs the bedside 
                phone. Affecting calm -
                                     PATRICK2
                           JOHNNY1, can we get out of here? As 
                           soon as possible.

        39      EXT. DRIVE, CHEATLEY, THE COTSWOLDS 1990 - NIGHT           39
                And here is SONNY2, shifty, checking his watch, waiting 
                nervously. 
                Flaming torches light the driveway as BRIDGET hurries her 
                mother into a battered local mini-cab. VIRGINIA peers into 
                her purse.
                                     BRIDGET2
                           We’ll let you know when it’s time 
                           to come back. Not too early!
                                     VIRGINIA2
                           Righty-o!
                                     BRIDGET2
                           Please don’t say ‘righty-o’.
                                     VIRGINIA2
                           Sorry. Must have caught it off your 
                           father!
                                     BRIDGET2
                           Now do you have some money?
                                     VIRGINIA2
                           I think so. The cab from the 
                           station was more expensive than 
                           I...
                But the royal car is approaching. Panic.
                                     BRIDGET2
                           Here comes the Princess! For 
                           goodness sake, I’ll pay you back 
                           later! Go! Drive, drive!
                And she waves the minicab off. SONNY2 arrives.

                                     BRIDGET2 (CONT’D)
                           Now remember. Don’t fawn.
                                     SONNY22
                           Righty-o.
                                     BRIDGET2
                           Christ, not you too. 
                PATRICK2 and JOHNNY2 are walking up the drive, taking in the 
                flaming torches, the liveried WAITERS, the splendour of it 
                all -
                                     PATRICK2
                           Bloody hell, BRIDGET1. 
                                     JOHNNY2
                           Only the best for SONNY1.
                They arrive just as PRINCESS MARGARET is stepping from her 
                car. Along with one LADY-IN-WAITING, luggage, one SECURITY 
                MAN. BRIDGET1 curtsies - all from PATRICK1 and JOHNNY1’s POV.
                                     PATRICK2
                           Stay close. Don’t go too far away.
                                     JOHNNY2
                           I won’t. Hold your nerve. It’s 
                           going to be fine.
        40      INT. RECEPTION ROOM, CHEATLEY, THE COTSWOLDS 1990 - NIGHT 40
                In a grand, high-ceilinged Reception Room, SONNY1 and his 
                inner-circle are awaiting the Princess’s arrival. There are 
                twenty or so guests for drinks and dinner. NICHOLAS2 PRATT 
                stands with JACQUES and JACQUELINE D’ALANTOUR, the French 
                Ambassador and his wife. 
                                     JACQUELINE
                           So this old flame of yours, BRIDGET1 
                           Gravesend, she is bien née?
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           Not at all. Father was very used-
                           car-salesman, mother pure Surrey 
                           Pines.
                                     JACQUES
                           ‘Not quite from the top basket’ as 
                           you say.
                                     JACQUELINE
                           And is that why you didn’t marry 
                           her?
      Patrick Melrose - 'Some Hope' - Ep3                                 24
                                     NICHOLAS
                           Pas du tout. I’m quite bien né 
                           enough for two. No, I’m happy to 
                           associate with everyone, from the 
                           monarch to the humblest baronet in 
                           the land.
                                     JACQUELINE
                           But there are so many varieties of 
                           snobbery. Some, like not having 
                           pigs at one’s table, are simply 
                           common sense..
                                     JACQUES
                           And yet, as ambassador, it is 
                           sometimes necessary to have pigs at 
                           one’s table.
                                     JACQUELINE
                           If they are at one’s table, they 
                           are no longer pigs. 
                While the three of them enjoy the wisdom of this remark, 
                NICHOLAS spots PATRICK and raises his glass.
                                     PATRICK2
                           All the old faces. I wouldn’t be 
                           surprised if my fucking DAVID1 
                           leapt out from behind a pillar. 
                           ‘Supri-ise!’

                           No, thank you.
                                     PATRICK2
                           Years since I spoke to a stranger 
                           without drugs -
                                     JOHNNY2
                           Even when we did take drugs, all we 
                           ever saw was the inside of loos.
                                     PATRICK2
                           Yes, nowadays when I go to the loo, 
                           I say to myself, what are you doing 
                           here? You don’t take drugs anymore. 
                           It’s only after I’ve stormed out 
                           that I remember I need a piss -

                           I suppose ‘the young’ will be 
                           taking ecstasy this evening.

                                     PATRICK2
                           Call me old-fashioned, but I don’t 
                           like the sound of a non-addictive 
                           drug. If it’s not going to fuck you 
                           up, what’s the point?

                           No, thank you.
                                     JOHNNY2
                           I feel a bit stupid, saying this to 
                           you, but..if you did want to talk -

                               (- then regretfully)
                           Yes. Of course. I’m sorry.

                           I kept hearing that you’d died. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           Just once or twice. BRIDGET2, you 
                           look lovely. 
                                     JOHNNY2

                           I’ve put you with someone who’ll 
                           keep an eye on you. My cousin, 
                           MARY2. 
                A WOMAN in evening dress. MARY2, late-20s, wise, calm, 
                watchful - we’ll see more of her. 
                                     BRIDGET2 (CONT’D)
                           Ah, here she is! 
                PRINCESS MARGARET enters and all eyes turn - our first proper 
                look. There’s not a fanfare exactly, silence instead as SONNY 
                and BRIDGET rush to her side.

                                     BRIDGET2 (CONT’D)
                           Remember, don’t sit down until P.M. 
                           sits down!
                As all heads turn to P.M., PATRICK2 catches MARY2’s eye. 
                Conspicuously not applauding. She smiles back.
        41      INT. DINING ROOM, CHEATLEY, THE COTSWOLDS 1990 - NIGHT     41
                The high double doors swing open, and PRINCESS MARGARET and 
                SONNY head into the dining room. It looks sumptuous, but P.M. 
                has seen many, many rooms like this. 
                                     TONY FOWLES
                           Of course I love the countryside, 
                           but I do wish everything would stay 
                           still. I’m so aesthetic, I want to 
                           arrange the cows and glue them to 
                           the spot.
                                     PRINCESS MARGARET
                           Tony, you are funny!
                                     SONNY2
                               (watching this)
                           What’s he doing here anyway? Bloody 
                           Rasputin - 
                                     BRIDGET2
                           You’re ridiculous, a ridiculous 
                           snob.
                                     SONNY2
                               (separating P.M. and TONY)
                           Ma’am, if I could just - 
                                     PRINCESS MARGARET
                           Oh. Why? Where am I sitting?
                                     SONNY2
                           Next to the French Ambassador, 
                           ma’am.
                PRINCESS MARGARET’s disappointment is palpable.
                                     JACQUES
                           I think it was Marcel Proust who 
                           said that the number of guests at 
                           dinner should be more than the 
                           graces and less than the muses, but 
                           this is something absolutely 
                           extraordinary.
                                     PRINCESS MARGARET
                           I don’t know what you’re talking 
                           about. Shall we get started?
      Patrick Melrose - 'Some Hope' - Ep3                                 27
                Everyone stands ready. PATRICK2, distracted, sits, notes his 
                error, stands. The PRINCESS sits, which means the rest of the 
                guests can sit too.
        42      INT. DINING ROOM, CHEATLEY, THE COTSWOLDS 1990 - NIGHT     42
                Dinner is now underway, and the seating plan is as below;
                JACQUELINE - - TONY, BRIDGET2, JACQUES, MARGA., SONNY2 - JOHNNY2 
                - - - - MARY2, PATRICK2, NICHOLAS2 -- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
                Seated in the centre, P.M. is holding forth.
                                     PRINCESS MARGARET
                           - my lady-in-waiting leant over to 
                           the taxi driver and said ‘take us 
                           to the Royal Garden Hotel’ which, 
                           as you know, is at the bottom of 
                           the drive, and the taxi driver 
                           nodded at me and said -  
                               (sort-of Cockney accent)
                           ‘I know were she lives!’
                                     SONNY2
                               (laughing extravagantly)
                           What a wonderful story! What 
                           wonderful people! Salt of the 
                           earth!
                Meanwhile, the WAITER goes to pour white wine. PATRICK2 
                declines. He is intensely uncomfortable, fidgety, ill-at-
                ease. MARY2 notes all of this and makes an attempt at casual 
                conversation.
                                     MARY2
                           I saw you earlier.
                                     PATRICK2
                           Hm?
                                     MARY2
                           In reception. We’re staying at the 
                           same hotel. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           Ah! Home of the famous Cotswold 
                           Carvery. 
                                     MARY2
                           ‘Book early to avoid 
                           disappointment’.
                                     PATRICK2
                           If only I’d known it was so easy. 
                           To avoid disappointment, I mean.
      Patrick Melrose - 'Some Hope' - Ep3                                 28
                                     MARY2
                           Would you rather be there than 
                           here?
                                     PATRICK2
                           Almost anywhere. And yet if I 
                           wasn’t here, it’s the only place 
                           I’d want to be.
                                     MARY2
                           So how do you manage?
                                     PATRICK2
                           Hm?
                                     MARY2
                           To avoid disappointment? 
                PATRICK2 is surprised to be almost enjoying himself now.
                                     PATRICK2
                           It’s impossible. Salvation crumbles 
                           as soon as you touch it. I mean 
                           look at everyone - snobs, social 
                           climbers, museum pieces. 
                                     MARY2
                           I must say, I’m not quite sure why 
                           I’m here either. I think BRIDGET1 
                           likes the family to know she’s 
                           arrived.
                On BRIDGET1, unhappy, as P.M. talks to SONNY2.
                                     PATRICK2
                           I’m sure. But arrived where?
                Over to PRINCESS MARGARET.
                                     PRINCESS MARGARET
                               (Examining her fork -)
                           What is this? Venison? It’s hard to 
                           tell in this murky sauce.
                                     SONNY2
                           Yes, it is venison. I’m awfully 
                           sorry about the sauce. It’s 
                           perfectly disgusting. 
                                     PRINCESS MARGARET
                               (turning to D’ALANTOUR)
                           Do you like it? It’s venison.
                                     JACQUES
                           Really, it is something absolutely 
                           marvellous. The sauce is so subtle. 
                           I did not know one could find such 
                           cooking in this country...
      Patrick Melrose - 'Some Hope' - Ep3                                 29
                And in his enthusiasm, a gobbet of sauce flies off his fork 
                and lands on PRINCESS MARGARET’s dress. 
                                     JACQUES (CONT’D)
                           Ma’am. The sauce. I can only 
                           apologise...
                A terrible silence. 
                                     PRINCESS MARGARET
                           Wipe.
                                     JACQUES
                           I beg your pardon?
                                     PRINCESS MARGARET
                           I said wipe.
                                     BRIDGET2
                               (gripping the table)
                           Oh God. Oh God...
                And JACQUES has no choice but to dab his napkin in the water 
                and start to wipe at the brown spots.
                                     PRINCESS MARGARET
                           I thought I couldn’t dislike the 
                           sauce more when it was on my plate.
                                     SONNY2
                           The sauce has been a disaster, 
                           ma’am, I’m so sorry.
                                     PRINCESS MARGARET
                           There’s no need for you to 
                           apologise.
                While NICHOLAS2 relishes this, PATRICK2 can’t bear it - it’s 
                too reminiscent of the kind of scene he witnessed as a child. 
                Surely someone can intervene...
                But JACQUELINE D’ALANTOUR, proud and haughty, can bear it no 
                more. She stands and walks the length of the table.
                                     JACQUES
                           Jacqueline, I have done something 
                           unpardonable. 
                                     JACQUELINE
                           Ma’am, let me help you.
                                     PRINCESS MARGARET
                           He spilled it. He should wipe it 
                           up! In fact, one feels that he 
                           might have had a great career in 
                           dry-cleaning if he hadn’t been 
                           blown off course.
      Patrick Melrose - 'Some Hope' - Ep3                                 30
                                     JACQUELINE
                           Allez, Jacques, that’s enough.
                                     PRINCESS MARGARET
                           There’s still a spot here. Wipe it 
                           up!
                                     JACQUELINE
                               (she has had enough)
                           Non, c’est vraiment insupportable! 
                                     PRINCESS MARGARET
                           What is ‘insupportable’ is to be 
                           showered in this revolting sauce! I 
                           needn’t remind you that your 
                           husband is Ambassador to the Court 
                           of St James!
                A silence, a stand-off. JACQUELINE snaps first, bobbing 
                briefly then heading out of the room. The door slams.
                                     PRINCESS MARGARET (CONT’D)
                           A silence. I don’t approve of 
                           silences!
                               (back to SONNY2)
                           I get sent fallow dear from 
                           Richmond Park. You have to be on 
                           the list. The Queen said to me ‘Put 
                           yourself on the list.’ So I did.
                                     SONNY2
                           How very sensible, ma’am.
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           What I admire about Princess 
                           Margaret is the way she puts 
                           everyone at their ease.
                Conversation resumes but PATRICK2 sits, frozen.
                                     MARY2
                           Are you all right?
        43      INT. HALLWAY, CHEATLEY, THE COTSWOLDS 1990 - NIGHT         43
                The main course is being cleared. Outside the dining room, 
                JACQUELINE D’ALANTOUR paces and curses in vicious French, 
                railing against P.M.
                She is watched from the stairs by BELINDA in her nightdress.
                                     JACQUELINE
                           Hello, little girl. Who are you?
                                     BELINDA
                           I’m Belinda. Is Princess Margaret 
                           in there?

                                     JACQUELINE
                           Oh yes. Why don’t you go and say 
                           hello?
        44      INT. DINING ROOM, CHEATLEY, THE COTSWOLDS 1990 - NIGHT     44
                The desert course is being served.
                                     PRINCESS MARGARET
                           Remind me, SONNY2, do you have any 
                           children?
                                     SONNY2
                           Yes, indeed ma’am, a daughter, 
                           seven years-old. 
                                     PRINCESS MARGARET
                           No male heir then.
                                     SONNY2
                           Even so, I’m very fond of her.
                Over to NICHOLAS2, monopolising PATRICK2, who’d much rather be 
                talking to MARY2.
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           Of course, in many ways I feel 
                           responsible. It was I, after all, 
                           who introduced the humble Miss 
                           Watson-Scott, as she was then, to 
                           the beau monde at your dear 
                           father’s house. Who knew then that 
                           she was destined to command the 
                           very heights of society? You’re 
                           very lucky, a reprobate like you, 
                           invited to this glittering 
                           occasion. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           And I’m eternally grateful.
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           How are you managing?
                                     PATRICK2
                           Dying for a drink. 
                BELINDA has entered, and loiters nervously by the door, 
                unseen except PATRICK2 and MARY2. WAITERS weave around her.
                PATRICK2 waves at BELINDA. She waves back. MARY2 notices.

                bad enough...                                                                         *

                           Will you excuse me?
                PATRICK2 goes round the table to BELINDA, watched by MARY2.
                                     PATRICK2 (CONT’D)
                           Were you looking for someone?
                                     BELINDA
                           I wanted to meet Princess Margaret.
                                     PATRICK2
                           I see. Well, believe me, you’d be 
                           much better off without. Why don’t 
                           we ask BRIDGET1 to come?
                But now NICHOLAS has spotted BELINDA.
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           Oh look! It’s a little person who 
                           can’t sleep!
                                     PRINCESS MARGARET
                           Who is it?
                                     SONNY2
                           I’m afraid it’s my daughter, ma’am.
                                     PRINCESS MARGARET
                           She should be in bed. 
                BRIDGET turns -
                                     BRIDGET2
                           PATRICK2, thank you. What are you 
                           doing here, darling? This is a 
                           dinner for grown-ups.
                                     BELINDA
                           Which one’s Princess Margaret?
                                     JACQUELINE
                               (returning, mischievously)
                           Why don’t you get your mother to 
                           present you to her?
                                     BELINDA
                           Will you BRIDGET2? Please?

                PATRICK2 winces, BRIDGET2 hesitates. Meanwhile -
                                     PRINCESS MARGARET
                           Do you have any politics?
                                     SONNY2
                           Conservative, ma’am!
                BRIDGET and BELINDA arrive and wait patiently, PATRICK 
                nearby, watching.
                                     PRINCESS MARGARET
                           So I assumed, but are you involved 
                           in politics? For my own part, I 
                           don’t mind who’s in government so 
                           long as they’re good at governing. 
                           What we must avoid at all costs is 
                           these windscreen wipers: left, 
                           right, left, right...
                                     BRIDGET2
                           Ma’am, I wonder if I could 
                           introduce...
                                     PRINCESS MARGARET
                           Not now. She ought to be in bed. 
                           She’ll just get over-excited.
                                     SONNY2
                           Quite right. Honestly darling, how 
                           did she escape?
                BRIDGET2 looks at her husband with pure contempt.
                A moment, and she takes her daughter’s hand and walks briskly 
                out of the room.
                PATRICK2, too, watches all of this with a terrible sense of 
                recognition. What am I doing here? Get me out, get me out...
                                     SONNY2 (CONT’D)
                           And now I think perhaps we should 
                           join the others.
                                     PRINCESS MARGARET
                           Must we? We’ve been having such a 
                           cosy time. I do so hate big 
                           parties.
                                     SONNY2
                           Oh, me too. It was my BRIDGET1’s idea..

      Patrick Melrose - 'Some Hope' - Ep3                                 34
                The following sequence should have a sense of movement, of 
                continuous action, tuning in and out of conversations, 
                replicating the experience in real time. A single, flowing 
                take, or at least the illusion of one. 
                PART X EXT. MARQUEE / MARQUEE TERRACE (NIGHT FOR NIGHT): 
                Behind the house the band is on a small stage inside the 
                marquee, playing CANDLES ON THE CAKE.
                PART 1 EXT/INT. FRONT DRIVEWAY / ENTRANCE LOBBY (N/N):
                In front of the house PATRICK smokes with the trepidation of 
                a man about to face a firing squad. Guests are arriving, and 
                among them we find CINDY SMITH, an American model, impossibly 
                glamorous, and DAV WINFALL, not so glamorous.
                                     CINDY
                           Sonny and I are so grateful to you.
                                     DAV
                           Anything for Sonny. Try to avoid 
                           Bridget though. She can be rather 
                           fierce.
                                     CINDY
                           Of course -
                                     DAV
                           If security asks, you’re to pretend 
                           to be my wife.
                                     CINDY
                           How far am I meant to go?
                They join the party inside the house, and PATRICK2 looks after 
                them. He turns back to the arriving cars and sees - 
                DEBBIE, ex-girlfriend, talking to JULIA2, now JULIA2 BROGLIE, 
                his ex-lover, and glaring AMANDA.
                 PATRICK2 hurries indoors - a hand on his arm.
                                     GEORGE
                           My dear, what a nice surprise!
                PART 2 INT. ENTRANCE LOBBY (NIGHT FOR NIGHT):
                GEORGE WATFORD, very elderly now, sits in a chair in the 
                entrance hall. PATRICK2 is genuinely pleased to see him. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           George!
                                     GEORGE
                           I’m sitting here because I can’t 
                           hear anything otherwise.

                                     PATRICK2
                               (sitting)
                           I thought people were supposed to 
                           lead lives of quiet desperation.
                                     GEORGE
                           Not quiet enough. Have you found 
                           something you enjoy doing?
                                     PATRICK2
                           Yes, but sadly I’ve had to give 
                           that up. 
                                     GEORGE
                           Then you’re guilty of the greatest 
                           sin of all. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           Am I?
                                     GEORGE
                           Wasting time. You must make a 
                           contribution. No man is an island, 
                           though there are a surprising 
                           number here who own one. And not 
                           just in Scotland. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           Of course you’re right. My DAVID1 
                           once said to me ‘if you have a 
                           talent, use it. Or you’ll be 
                           miserable all your life.’ It was 
                           almost the only non-hostile remark 
                           DAVID1 ever made. 
                                     GEORGE
                           He was a very brilliant man, but 
                           never happy I think. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           Yes, well, I hardly ever think 
                           about him these days. 
                                     GEORGE
                           Whatever you feel, DAVID1 would have 
                           hated you to make the same 
                           mistakes. PATRICK2 - 
                               (gripping his hand)
                           No more wasted time.
                This hits its mark. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           I must go and find my  -

                PART 3 INT. ENTRANCE LOBBY / MAIN LOBBY / MUSIC ROOM (N/N):
                Leaving George, he continues to move into the next room where 
                he suddenly finds himself facing DEBBIE. She’s not pleased to 
                see him.
                                     DEBBIE
                           PATRICK2.
                                     PATRICK2
                           Debbie. You look lovely. But you 
                           always did at parties.
                                     DEBBIE
                           I’m surprised you can remember. You  
                           were either upstairs in bed with 
                           someone else, or passed out in the 
                           loo - 
                                     PATRICK2
                           Yes, well, that’s something I 
                           wanted to talk to you about. I 
                           don’t think I was terribly nice to 
                           you and -
                                     DEBBIE
                           I know this one. It’s a twelve-step 
                           thing, isn’t it? I’m on your ‘moral 
                           inventory’. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           No, I just - 
                                     DEBBIE
                           Will you excuse me?
                And while PATRICK2 winces, she heads off past -
                                     SONNY2
                               (coming down the stairs)
                           Dav, Cindy! You made it!
                                     CINDY
                           Happy Birthday, darling.
                                     DAV
                           SONNY2, are you sure this is all 
                           above board? BRIDGET1 just gave me 
                           the most terrible scowling look.
                                     SONNY2
                           Just stick to our story. You met 
                           Cindy, wife couldn’t come, asked 
                           her instead, didn’t check, nothing 
                           to do with me. 
      Patrick Melrose - 'Some Hope' - Ep3                                 37
                                     DAV
                           Right. So, met Cindy, wife couldn’t 
                           come, asked Cindy instead...
                DAV sidles off. SONNY2 takes CINDY to a quieter corner of 
                the room and regards her with barely-concealed lust.
                                     SONNY2
                           Hello there. 
                                     CINDY
                           Happy Birthday, darling. 
                A kiss, a whisper. NICHOLAS2 and PATRICK2 watch this encounter 
                as we move in on them.
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           What I find with beautiful women is 
                           that, after one’s waited around for 
                           ages, they all arrive at once, as 
                           buses are supposed to do. Not that 
                           I’ve ever waited around for a bus. 
                           Oh look there’s Princess Margaret. 
                           One has to be careful not to trip 
                           over her. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           That was quite a scene.
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           Yes, I do admire P.M., she has 
                           something of DAVID1’s joie-de-
                           vivre. Imagine if they’d met!
                                     PATRICK2
                           Imagine. 
                But PATRICK2’s eye is drawn to BRIDGET2, who also watches 
                SONNY2, silent and despairing and drinking heavily.
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           The way she used a minor accident 
                           to screw the maximum humiliation 
                           out of the Ambassador. Of course 
                           I’m absolutely devoted to his wife 
                           who, behind all that phoney chic, 
                           is a genuinely malicious person -
                           (JACQUES and JACQUELINE arrive)
                           And here they are!
                                     PATRICK2
                           Will you excuse me? I must talk to 
                           our hostess.
                                     JACQUELINE
                           I hope we didn’t drive away your 
                           young friend. He seemed very 
                           nervous. 
      Patrick Melrose - 'Some Hope' - Ep3                                 38
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           Oh, we can do without him. Mon cher 
                           Jacques, I thought you were 
                           absolutely brilliant, the way you 
                           handled that tiresome woman...
                PATRICK2 has followed BRIDGET2 into the music room, has taken 
                her by the hand and sat her down. But now PRINCESS MARGARET 
                is approaching.
                                     JACQUES
                           Thank you, but I feel the royal 
                           presence bearing down on us. 
                           Perhaps we should explore the 
                           depths of the party. 
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           My dear fellow you are the depths 
                           of the party. Au revoir!
                And they flee, just as PRINCESS MARGARET arrives and walks 
                with him into the music room.
                                     PRINCESS MARGARET
                           Consorting with the enemy?
                                     NICHOLAS2
                           They came to me for sympathy, but I 
                           told them they’d come to the wrong 
                           place! He’s a clumsy fool, and as 
                           to his absurd wife...
                AMANDA PRATT arrives, smiling, interrupting NICHOLAS.
                                     AMANDA
                           Hello there! Isn’t this a lovely 
                           party?
                               (a nod to P.M.)
                           Ma’am.
                                     NICHOLAS2
                               (chilly)
                           I’ll come and find you later. 
                           Alright?
                AMANDA heads off, downcast.
                                     PRINCESS MARGARET
                           Who was that?
                                     NICHOLAS
                           My daughter. Now where was I, I’ve 
                           quite lost my flow -
                ...and now over P.M.’s shoulder, to BRIDGET2 and PATRICK2, 
                talking fondly. 
      Patrick Melrose - 'Some Hope' - Ep3                                 39
                                     BRIDGET2
                           ...the main thing I remember, apart 
                           from your poisonous DAVID1, was 
                           that beautiful house.
                                     PATRICK2
                           Nothing compared to all of this. 
                                     BRIDGET2
                           Yes, funny how things turn out. 
                           It’s all lovely, I just wish it 
                           wasn’t full of such awful shits. 
                           Not you, of course. Or VIRGINIA1 -
                Behind PATRICK2, VIRGINIA2 has wandered into the party, rather 
                dazed, clutching her large handbag.
                                     PATRICK2
                           You seemed so incredibly cool to 
                           me. Not like my parents’ usual 
                           crowd at all. And so kind too. When 
                           you’re young you notice kindness.
                                     BRIDGET2
                           Kind. You’re sure you’re not 
                           confusing me with someone else? -
                               (VIRGINIA2’s passing)
                           You wouldn’t be an angel and talk 
                           to her for a second, would you?
                               (before he can object)
                           VIRGINIA2? This is my old friend 
                           PATRICK2 Melrose...
                PATRICK2 smiles at VIRGINIA2.
                                     PATRICK2
                           So! Quite a party!
                PART 4 INT. MUSIC ROOM / MAIN LOBBY / BLUE DRAWING RM (N/N):
                - and now we follow BRIDGET into the main hall as she tracks 
                SONNY, still talking to CINDY. DAV intercepts her, sweaty 
                and eager for exoneration.
                                     DAV
                           Bridget! Lovely party! I just 
                           wanted to clarify - I met Cindy, my 
                           wife couldn’t come...
                But she brushes past him and watches as, in the drawing room, 
                SONNY2 grabs a glass of champagne, presses it on CINDY, who 
                places one hand, momentarily, on her stomach. SONNY2 laughs, 
                touches that hand tenderly, whispers in her ear, then turns 
                back.
                Quickly, BRIDGET2 turns out of sight, shaken, confused - 
                - as TONY FOWLES arrives; coked-up, melodramatic.
      Patrick Melrose - 'Some Hope' - Ep3                                 40
                                     TONY FOWLES
                           What is it, darling?
                                     BRIDGET2
                           Oh, I just saw Cindy Smith with 
                           SONNY1. I said we shouldn’t invite 
                           her because we didn’t know her and 
                           now she’s here and...oh, I’m just 
                           being paranoid.
                                     TONY FOWLES
                           Yes. Probably.
                                     BRIDGET2
                           Probably paranoid?
                                     TONY FOWLES
                               (a moment’s thought, then)
                           Is there somewhere we can go?
                And as she takes him by the arm, BRIDGET2 looks back, but 
                SONNY2 has disappeared. 
                PART 5 EXT. MARQUEE / MARQUEE TERRACE (NIGHT FOR NIGHT):
                Patrick is outside on the lawn, watching the crowd dance in 
                the marquee. SONNY2, now drunk, joins him -
                                     SONNY2
                           PATRICK2 Melrose, why aren’t you 
                           drinking?
                On stage, the BAND LEADER is introducing each musician, after 
                which they play a brief solo.
                                     PATRICK2
                           Sonny. Happy Birthday!
                             SONNY2                        BAND LEADER                                 *
                I frightfully dislike this       On saxophone, Joe Martin!                            *
                bit. What makes him think we 
                wanted to know their names?
                             SONNY2                   BAND LEADER (CONT'D)                             *
                I saw you talking to BRIDGET1.    And on cornet, ‘CHILLY WILLY2’                        *
                Is she having fun, d’you         Watson!                                              *
                think? She does look                                                                  *
                stormy....                                                                            *
                PATRICK2 hears the BAND LEADER’s announcement and strains to 
                see the cornet player, but -

                               (a rescue)
                           Sonny, may I steal PATRICK2 for one 
                           moment?

                                be?)
                           Everything alright?
                                     PATRICK2
                           What? Yes, I thought I -  
                                     JOHNNY2
                           Let’s go here -
                               (a little quieter)
                           I thought I’d save you from our 
                           host.
                And we return to SONNY2 in the crowd - an urgent, whispered 
                conversation with CINDY. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           There’s a blast of palpable 
                           stupidity that comes from that man, 
                           like opening the door of a sauna.
                               (Anxious, SONNY2 hurries 
                                through the crowd)
                           My God, look at them all. I 
                           remember these people from my 
                           childhood. Hard and dull. 
                                     JOHNNY2
                           They’re the last Marxists.
                               (PATRICK2 - ‘go on’)
                           The last people to believe class is 
                           a total explanation. When they’ve 
                           lost that doctrine in Peking and 
                           Moscow, it’ll still flourish under 
                           the marquees of England. The true 
                           heirs of Marx and Lenin.

                           And a little bit of 
                           Gloucestershire. Let’s get out of 
                           here.
                But JULIA2 arrives - 
                                     JULIA2
                           What are you two muttering about? 
                           Hello, stranger -
                               (kissing his cheek)
                           Oh, Christ -
                               (arriving -)
                           JOHNNY2, PATRICK2, this is my 
                           husband, Angus.
                Bearded, Scottish, a little dull. They shake hands.
                                     ANGUS
                           Quite a party. Must have cost a 
                           pretty penny!

                                     JULIA2
                           My husband is obsessed with how 
                           much everything costs. Why don’t 
                           you go and get me a drink. They’re 
                           free. JOHNNY2 will help you.
                                     PATRICK2
                           Actually, JOHNNY2 and I were about 
                           to -
                A glance of exasperation from JOHNNY1 as he leaves with ANGUS.
                                     JULIA2
                               (watching ANGUS)
                           My husband. He looked so good on 
                           paper but he’s completely obsessed 
                           with whether a cheap-day return is 
                           refundable if you don’t use the 
                           second half. 
                               (PATRICK2 laughs)
                           Shall we go exploring?
                               (they head into the house, 
                                JULIA2 still holding her 
                                champagne glass)
                           It’s very good to see you again. I 
                           thought perhaps you’d been avoiding 
                           me. As a bad influence.
                                     PATRICK2
                           Not you. The world.
                                     JULIA2
                           You’re here now. Perhaps we can 
                           liven up this dreary party.
                                     PATRICK2
                           You certainly have to kick a lot of 
                           bodies before you find a live one.
                                     JULIA2
                           Tony’s got some charlie, but I 
                           suppose that’s against the rules.
                In the crowd, we find TONY FOWLES, who is slipping a wrap of 
                cocaine to AMANDA.
                                     PATRICK2
                           I think technically, yes. 
                                     JULIA2
                           Christ, why are you all so dull? 
                           Men used to tell me how they used 
                           butter for sex. Now they tell me 
                           how they’ve eliminated it from 
                           their diet. Look, there’s Debbie.
                               (DEBBIE joins TONY)
                           Doesn’t she look beautiful?

                                     PATRICK2
                           Very. Well, I’d better go find 
                           JOHNNY1 - 
                                     JULIA2
                           We could always go upstairs. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           Upstairs. What for?
                                     JULIA2
                           For sex. No strings. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           Well, I suppose it’s something to 
                           do.
                                     JULIA2
                           Thank you.
                                     PATRICK2
                           No, no, I’m really keen.
                                     JULIA2
                           Well then, let’s go. Before my 
                           husband gets back.
                PART 6 INT. DINING ROOM / BLUE DRAWING ROOM (N/N):
                PATRICK2 and JULIA2 move through the house. At the bottom of 
                the stairs, they approach a SECURITY GUARD.
                                     SECURITY GUARD
                           I’m sorry, ma’am, the house is 
                           closed to - 
                                     JULIA2
                               (with supreme confidence)
                           We’re staying here.
                The SECURITY GUARD hesitates but shrinks under her glare, 
                lets them through.
                                     JULIA2 (CONT’D)
                           Thank you!
                PART 7 INT. LANDING / STAIRCASE (NIGHT FOR NIGHT):
                Up the stairs -
                                     PATRICK2
                           I can’t help thinking this is a 
                           terrible idea.
                                     JULIA2
                           Shhhh! Listen!
                The sound of shouting is coming from the end of the hall. 
      Patrick Melrose - 'Some Hope' - Ep3                                 44
                There we can see SONNY1 and BRIDGET1, their furious row 
                happening simultaneously with JULIA2 and PATRICK2’s 
                conversation.
                As PATRICK2 and JULIA2 listen in -
                                     BRIDGET1
                           ...and you invited her! Here, to 
                           our home, with our daughter 
                           sleeping upstairs, surely you can 
                           see how... monstrous and 
                           humiliating that is?
                             SONNY1                     BRIDGET1 (CONT'D)
                Could we perhaps talk about      No! We will talk about it now 
                it in the morning?               - 
                                     SONNY1
                            - because the guests are going to 
                           start wondering where we - 
                                     BRIDGET1
                           I don’t CARE about your fucking 
                           guests! Tell me - is it the first 
                           time she’s been here?
                                     SONNY1
                           What?
                                     BRIDGET1
                           To the house, is this the first 
                           time she has been a guest in our 
                           house?
                                     SONNY1
                           Yes! 
                                     BRIDGET1
                           Sonny - 
                                     SONNY1
                           No. No, she has been here once, 
                           maybe twice before - 
                                     BRIDGET1
                           And where was I?
                                     SONNY1
                           In London, I think, seeing friends. 
                                     BRIDGET1
                           And did you fuck her here?
                                     SONNY1
                           What?
                                     BRIDGET1
                           Did. You. Fuck. Her -

                                     SONNY1
                           I don’t have to answer all these 
                           quest -
                                     BRIDGET1
                           Did you fuck her here?
                                     SONNY1
                           Yes, but not in our bedroom!
                                     JULIA2
                           You must have heard.
                                     PATRICK2
                           About the affair?
                                     JULIA2
                           It gets better. Cindy’s pregnant. 
                           With a precious boy-child. SONNY1’s 
                           so desperate for a male heir he’s 
                           going to make Cindy the next 
                           Countess of Gravesend. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           Poor BRIDGET1. 
                                     JULIA2
                           - like some sort of tin-pot Henry 
                           VIII. Honestly, you have to laugh.
                                     PATRICK2
                           Well, you don’t have to laugh.
                                     JULIA2
                           Don’t be so pious. Serves her 
                           right.
                                     PATRICK2
                           What for?

                           You know what for. All that 
                           climbing. No wonder she looks so 
                           tired.
                                     PATRICK2
                           You know, I have my reservations 
                           about your character.

                           Oh, me too!
                BRIDGET2, tearful but furious, is walking away from a dazed 
                SONNY1. JULIA1 hears her approach -

                And she takes his hand and takes him along, and we leave THE

                In the dark room, PATRICK2 and JULIA2 are beginning to make 
                love, standing against the wall. It’s very passionate, so 
                much so that JULIA2’s champagne glass falls and breaks. 
                                     JULIA2
                           Guess who I’m having an affair 
                           with?
                                     PATRICK2
                           Do we have to discuss this now?
                                     JULIA2
                           Your friend JOHNNY1.
                                     PATRICK2
                           Well, that’s put me right off.
                                     JULIA2
                               (an attempt at reignition)
                           I thought you might want to steal 
                           me back. JOHNNY1’s perfectly nice 
                           but that’s the problem.
                               (she kisses him)
                           I was so pleased when I heard you 
                           were coming tonight. PATRICK2 
                           Melrose. It took me by surprise. 
                           The fact is, I’ve missed you.
                                     PATRICK2
                           Me too. But I think...I think I’d 
                           rather stay friends with JOHNNY1.
                                     JULIA2
                           Really?
                                     PATRICK2
                           I don’t want more irony and 
                           tension.
                                     JULIA2
                           But you love irony and tension!
                                     PATRICK2
                           You just imagine everyone’s like 
                           you.
                                     JULIA2
                           Fuck off, PATRICK2 
                                     PATRICK2
                           Look, we’d better part now, don’t 
                           you think? Before we have a row.

                The door closes, and PATRICK2 is alone again.
                He lights a cigarette, looks around for somewhere to use as 
                an ashtray. The doll’s house? He sees JULIA’s broken 
                champagne glass. He throws the cigarette out the window, and 
                picks it up- 
                He holds the glass in his hand a moment. A memory. Then, 
                walking with some purpose, he heads out -

                           I was looking for you. Where have 
                           you been?

                With some urgency -

                           I told you there was something I’ve 
                           never said out loud and never 
                           would. And now I’m going to. 
                           Forgive my inarticulacy, it’s not 
                           that I’m embarrassed, it’s...I 
                           don’t want it to be a burden for 
                           you.

                           So. I’ve told you about my parents’ 
                           drunkenness and the violence, but 
                           what I was skirting around was - 
                A WAITER enters, offering drinks.
                                     PATRICK2/JOHNNY2
                           No thank you/Not now.

                           Well now you know. The first 
                           incident masqueraded as a 
                           punishment, though I never knew the 
                           crime which gave it a certain 
                           Kafkaesque charm -

                           Yes, I think that’s what happened. 
                           What makes you say that?

                           It just seemed obvious.

                           When it was happening, in that 
                           moment - this will sound strange - 
                           there was a lizard on the wall, a 
                           gecko, bright green and I thought, 
                           if I can somehow put myself 
                           inside...I might get through this. 
                           Not much of an escape plan, I know. 
                           The point is now I’m exhausted by 
                           hating DAVID1. It’s not enough, and if 
                           I’m going to break into the world, 
                           not just this -
                               (the party)
                           - but the real world, to learn 
                           something, make a contribution, 
                           live rather than just survive, then 
                           I’m going to have to say these

                A crackle and bang from outside. The fireworks have begun.

                           VIRGINIA2, I don’t know, let’s decide 
                           when we get there. 
                                     VIRGINIA2
                           Whatever makes you happy. 
                BRIDGET2, remorseful, takes in her mother cradling BELINDA. 
                She comes and sits with her.
                                     BRIDGET2
                           I’ve treated you dreadfully 
                           sometimes. Snobbishly.

                           Oh, no. Only sometimes. Your father 
                           always blamed that NICHOLAS1 Pratt 
                           man. You were such a nice girl 
                           until you met him, but then you 
                           started criticising everything at 
                           home, people you’d known all your 
                           life, perfectly nice people. Your 
                           father always loved you, but I 
                           can’t pretend he wasn’t hurt 
                           sometimes. Have I said too much?
                                     BRIDGET2
                           Not at all. 
                She takes her hand.  A moment, then - 
                                     VIRGINIA2
                           Let’s have a nice long talk 
                           tomorrow. We should probably get 
                           started. We’ve a long way to go.
        53A     INT. UPSTAIRS TERRACE, CHEATLEY, THE COTSWOLDS, 1990 - NIGHT53A
                JOHNNY2 and PATRICK2 stand in silence.
                                     JOHNNY2
                           I’m not recruiting, I swear -
                                     PATRICK2
                           Go on -
                                     JOHNNY2
                           But perhaps the only way to move on 
                           is to become more detached about 
                           yourself and more attached to 
                           something else -
                                     PATRICK2
                           A hobby you mean -
                                     JOHNNY2
                           - or someone else -
                                     PATRICK2
                           Fall in love, have kids -

                           Why not?
                                     PATRICK2
                           I tried falling in love, many 
                           times, as you know -
                                     JOHNNY2
                           Not sure I’d call that love -

                                     PATRICK2
                           Even so, my experience of love is 
                           that you get excited thinking 
                           someone can mend your broken heart, 
                           disappointed when you realise they 
                           can’t.
                                     JOHNNY2
                           But the next time.
                                     PATRICK2
                           Hm. Of course, the other danger is 
                           that without bitterness, spite, 
                           sarcasm, snobbery and self-
                           loathing, there might be nothing 
                           left.
                                     JOHNNY2
                           Perhaps. Or think what you could 
                           put there instead.

                As fireworks continue, PRINCESS MARGARET, a little woozy now, 
                is retreating, pursued by an inebriated JACQUES D’ALANTOUR.
                                     JACQUES
                           Ma’am! Ma’am, wait. Ma’am, I wished 
                           to apologise. I think it was 
                           Talleyrand who said -
                VIRGINIA2, BRIDGET2 and the sleeping BELINDA are struggling 
                down the stairs with the suitcase. 
                                     PRINCESS MARGARET
                           Ah, there’s our hostess! I wanted 
                           to find SONNY1...
                BRIDGET2 regards the Princess coldly. Then -
                                     BRIDGET2
                           I really couldn’t care less. Ma’am.
                And they hurry off, leaving P.M. alone.

                SONNY2, GEORGE, and NICHOLAS2 are smoking cigarettes in a 
                huddle near the entrance.
                                     SONNY2
                           I’ve been a bloody fool.

                           I can’t say I disagree.

                get into their car -

                           But I was driven to it! BRIDGET1’s 
                           not having a son has been 
                           frightfully hard but I’m not sure I 
                           like the idea of life without her. 
                           And Cindy has got some very 
                           peculiar ideas. She’s already 
                           suggested I knock a wall through, 
                           and the way she looks at the 
                           furniture, like a bloody auctioneer 
                           -

                           Isn’t that BRIDGET2 now?
                The engine starts, and SONNY2 drops his glass and starts to 
                run after it.
                                     SONNY2
                           BRIDGET2! BRIDGET2, where are you 
                           going! Stop! Stop the car!
                VIRGINIA2 looks back through the rear window and sees her son-
                in-law on the grand drive behind them, gasping.
                She allows herself a smile.

                A general exodus is taking place. The BAND are packing their 
                stuff away, WAITERS are clearing up glasses. 
                PATRICK2 and JOHNNY2 walk towards the car.
                                     PATRICK2
                           I wonder if there’s some 
                           alternative to hatred.

                           Forgiveness?
                                     PATRICK2
                           Oh, I’m sure DAVID1 was 
                           intensely unhappy, but to forgive 
                           someone, doesn’t there have to be 
                           some effort to change?

                           need forgiving -
                The INSENSITIVE WAITER is passing with a tray of glasses. 
                PATRICK2 spots him.  
                                     PATRICK2
                           Excuse me, hello. Look, I’m sorry 
                           if I snapped at you earlier, I was 
                           in the middle of saying something 
                           rather tricky.
                                     WAITER
                           I was only doing my job.
                                     PATRICK2
                           Of course you were, and I 
                           apologise.
                                     JOHNNY2
                           So do you think there’s any way to 
                           forgive him?
                                     WAITER
                           Of course. It wasn’t that bad.
                                     JOHNNY2
                           No, not you!
                JOHNNY2 and PATRICK2 laugh. The WAITER tuts and leaves.

                           Well if the waiter can forgive 
                           me... You go ahead. I don’t think 
                           I’ll be able to sleep yet, and the 
                           thought of that hotel room -
                                     JOHNNY2
                           Well - thanks for telling me.

                           No need to get Californian about 
                           it.

                           miracle, man. It’s a miracle that 
                           we don’t melt in the bath like a 
                           piece of soap.

                And CHILLY WILLY2 heads off. 
                                     MARY2
                           Nice to meet you.
                PATRICK2 turns and sees MARY2, walking towards him. 
                                     PATRICK2
                           You too - 
                               (a thought - why not?)
                           See you at breakfast perhaps. 
                                     MARY2
                           Yes. Why not? The Cotswold Carvery? 
                                     PATRICK2
                           Around nine perhaps.
                                     MARY2
                           Avoid disappointment.
                And she walks on, smiling. PATRICK2 watches MARY2 go.

                And now PATRICK2 is alone, walking away from the house, the 
                smoke from the fireworks still hanging in the air.
                It’s very late - almost early - and there’s the hint of a 
                lightening in the eastern sky. 
                Still, he’s not quite ready for sleep. Instead he strides off 
                across the grass towards an ornamental lake. 
                At the edge of the water, he stops and lights his last 
                cigarette and crumples the pack.
                PATRICK2 bends down, finds a stick, feels its weight in his 
                hand and hurls it out into the lake.
                As it breaks the water -
                                                                   CUT TO:

                Blazing Provençal light. August.
                A BLUR OF MOTION through broken vines, as a YOUNG BOY tumbles 
                down the serried terraces that cover the steep slope beneath 
                the chateau. He slashes at the vines left and right with his 
                plastic sword, leaping over the terraced walls, flying 
                almost.

                In a clearing stands a well, its depths concealed with a 
                wooden cover. THE BOY approaches and climbs up onto the edge. 
                He points his toe, tests the air above the well. 
                Then JUMPS. And lands. 
                Concrete. Dead leaves. The well has been sealed. No longer

                                     A VOICE (O.S.)
                           ROBERT2! ROBERT1, where are you?
                ROBERT2 MELROSE stops immediately, caught in the act, then 
                jumps down and runs back towards the house.
        62      EXT. TERRACE, THE CHATEAU, LACOSTE 2002 - MORNING          62
                PATRICK MELROSE, twelve years older than the man at the 
                party, shouts across the diminished grounds. 
                He is joined by MARY, who carries their second son THOMAS.
                They stand and watch their son hurtling towards the house. 
                                     PATRICK
                           Robert, hurry up! Your grandmother 
                           wants you. Come and say hello to 
                           Eleanor!
